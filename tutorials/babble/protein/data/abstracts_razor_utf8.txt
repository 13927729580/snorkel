28582834	Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are a common cause of autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain protein containing GTPase and kinase enzymatic domains.  Disease-associated mutations in LRRK2 variably influence enzymatic activity with the common G2019S variant leading to enhanced kinase activity. Mutant LRRK2 induces neuronal toxicity through a kinase-dependent mechanism suggesting that kinase activity is important for mediating the pathogenic effects of LRRK2 mutations. A number of LRRK2 kinase substrates have been identified in vitro but whether they represent authentic physiological substrates in mammalian cells or tissues is not yet clear. The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein, 4E-BP1, was recently identified as a potential substrate of LRRK2 kinase activity in vitro and in Drosophila with phosphorylation occurring at Thr37 and Thr46. Here, we explore a potential interaction of LRRK2 and 4E-BP1 in mammalian cells and brain. We find that LRRK2 can weakly phosphorylate 4E-BP1 in vitro but LRRK2 overexpression is not able to alter endogenous 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in mammalian cells. In mammalian neurons LRRK2 and 4E-BP1 display minimal co-localization, whereas the subcellular distribution, protein complex formation and covalent post-translational modification of endogenous 4E-BP1 are not altered in the brains of LRRK2 knockout or mutant LRRK2 transgenic mice. In the brain, the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr37 and Thr46 does not change in LRRK2 knockout or mutant LRRK2 transgenic mice, nor is 4E-BP1 phosphorylation altered in idiopathic or G2019S mutant PD brains. Collectively, our results suggest that 4E-BP1 is neither a major nor robust physiological substrate of LRRK2 in mammalian cells or brain.
28582849	Mutations in LRRK2, encoding the multifunctional protein leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), are a common cause of Parkinson disease. LRRK2 has been suggested to influence the cytoskeleton as LRRK2 mutants reduce neurite outgrowth and cause an accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau. This might cause alterations in the dynamic instability of microtubules suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Here, we describe a direct interaction between LRRK2 and beta-tubulin. This interaction is conferred by the LRRK2 Roc domain and is disrupted by the familial R1441G mutation and artificial Roc domain mutations that mimic autophosphorylation. LRRK2 selectively interacts with three beta-tubulin isoforms: TUBB, TUBB4, and TUBB6, one of which (TUBB4) is mutated in the movement disorder dystonia type 4 (DYT4). Binding specificity is determined by lysine 362 and alanine 364 of beta-tubulin. Molecular modeling was used to map the interaction surface to the luminal face of microtubule protofibrils in close proximity to the lysine 40 acetylation site in alpha-tubulin. This location is predicted to be poorly accessible within mature stabilized microtubules, but exposed in dynamic microtubule populations. Consistent with this finding, endogenous LRRK2 displays a preferential localization to dynamic microtubules within growth cones, rather than adjacent axonal microtubule bundles. This interaction is functionally relevant to microtubule dynamics, as mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from LRRK2 knock-out mice display increased microtubule acetylation. Taken together, our data shed light on the nature of the LRRK2 to tubulin interaction, and indicate that alterations in microtubule stability caused by changes in LRRK2 might contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease.
28582909	Mutations in LRRK2 play a critical role in both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Up to date, the role of LRRK2 in PD onset and progression remains largely unknown. However, experimental evidence highlights a critical role of LRRK2 in the control of vesicle trafficking that in turn may regulate different aspects of neuronal physiology. We have analyzed the role of LRRK2 in regulating dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) and D2 (DRD2) trafficking. DRD1 and DRD2 are the most abundant dopamine receptors in the brain. They differ in structural, pharmacological and biochemical properties, as well as in localization and internalization mechanisms. Our results indicate that disease-associated mutant G2019S LRRK2 impairs DRD1 internalization, leading to an alteration in signal transduction. Moreover, the mutant forms of LRRK2 affect receptor turnover by decreasing the rate of DRD2 trafficking from the Golgi complex to the cell membrane. Collectively, our findings are consistent with the conclusion that LRRK2 influences the motility of neuronal vesicles and the neuronal receptor trafficking. These findings have important implications for the complex role that LRRK2 plays in neuronal physiology and the possible pathological mechanisms that may lead to neuronal death in PD.
28582810	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disorder of movement, cognition, and emotion, and it is characterized pathologically by neuronal degeneration with Lewy bodies, which are cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing deposits of aggregated proteins. Most PD cases appear to be sporadic, but genetic forms of the disease, caused by mutations in alpha-synuclein, parkin, and other genes, have helped elucidate pathogenesis. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause autosomal-dominant Parkinsonism with clinical features of PD and with pleomorphic pathology including deposits of aggregated protein. To study expression and interactions of LRRK2, we synthesized cDNAs and generated expression constructs coding for human WT and mutant LRRK2 proteins. Expression of full-length LRRK2 in cells in culture suggests that the protein is predominately cytoplasmic, as is endogenous protein by subcellular fractionation. Using coimmunoprecipitation, we find that LRRK2, expressed in cells in culture, interacts with parkin but not with alpha-synuclein, DJ-1, or tau. A small proportion of the cells overexpressing LRRK2 contain protein aggregates, and this proportion is greatly increased by coexpression of parkin. In addition, parkin increases ubiquitination of aggregated protein. Also, mutant LRRK2 causes neuronal degeneration in both SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons. This cell model may be useful for studies of PD cellular pathogenesis and therapeutics. These findings suggest a gain-of-function mechanism in the pathogenesis of LRRK2-linked PD and suggest that LRRK2 may be involved in a pathogenic pathway with other PD-related proteins such as parkin, which may help illuminate both familial and sporadic PD."
28582819	Mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene, first described in 2004 have now emerged as the most important genetic finding in both autosomal dominant and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). While a formidable research effort has ensued since the initial gene discovery, little is known of either the normal or the pathological role of LRRK2. We have created lines of mice that express human wild-type (hWT) or G2019S Lrrk2 via bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenesis. In vivo analysis of the dopaminergic system revealed abnormal dopamine neurotransmission in both hWT and G2019S transgenic mice evidenced by a decrease in extra-cellular dopamine levels, which was detected without pharmacological manipulation. Immunopathological analysis revealed changes in localization and increased phosphorylation of microtubule binding protein tau in G2019S mice. Quantitative biochemical analysis confirmed the presence of differential phospho-tau species in G2019S mice but surprisingly, upon dephosphorylation the tau isoform banding pattern in G2019S mice remained altered. This suggests that other post-translational modifications of tau occur in G2019S mice. We hypothesize that Lrrk2 may impact on tau processing which subsequently leads to increased phosphorylation. Our models will be useful for further understanding of the mechanistic actions of LRRK2 and future therapeutic screening.
28582822	Mutations in human leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (Lrrk2), a protein of yet unknown function, are linked to Parkinson's disease caused by degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. The protein comprises several domains including a GTPase and a kinase domain both affected by several pathogenic mutations. To elucidate the molecular interaction network of endogenous Lrrk2 under stoichiometric constraints, we applied QUICK (quantitative immunoprecipitation combined with knockdown) in NIH3T3 cells. The identified interactome reveals actin isoforms as well as actin-associated proteins involved in actin filament assembly, organization, rearrangement, and maintenance, suggesting that the biological function of Lrrk2 is linked to cytoskeletal dynamics. In fact, we demonstrate Lrrk2 de novo binding to F-actin and its ability to modulate its assembly in vitro. When tested in intact cells, knockdown of Lrrk2 causes morphological alterations in NIH3T3 cells. In developing dopaminergic midbrain primary neurons, Lrrk2 knockdown results in shortened neurite processes, indicating a physiological role of Lrrk2 in cytoskeletal organization and dynamics of dopaminergic neurons. Hence, our results demonstrate that molecular interactions as well as the physiological function of Lrrk2 are closely related to the organization of the actin-based cytoskeleton, a crucial feature of neuronal development and neuron function.
28582826	Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD), but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and the normal function of this large multidomain protein remain speculative. To address the role of this protein in vivo, we generated three different LRRK2 mutant mouse lines. Mice completely lacking the LRRK2 protein (knock-out, KO) showed an early-onset (age 6 weeks) marked increase in number and size of secondary lysosomes in kidney proximal tubule cells and lamellar bodies in lung type II cells. Mice expressing a LRRK2 kinase-dead (KD) mutant from the endogenous locus displayed similar early-onset pathophysiological changes in kidney but not lung.  KD mutants had dramatically reduced full-length LRRK2 protein levels in the kidney and this genetic effect was mimicked pharmacologically in wild-type mice treated with a LRRK2-selective kinase inhibitor. Knock-in (KI) mice expressing the G2019S PD-associated mutation that increases LRRK2 kinase activity showed none of the LRRK2 protein level and histopathological changes observed in KD and KO mice. The autophagy marker LC3 remained unchanged but kidney mTOR and TCS2 protein levels decreased in KD and increased in KO and KI mice. Unexpectedly, KO and KI mice suffered from diastolic hypertension opposed to normal blood pressure in KD mice. Our findings demonstrate a role for LRRK2 in kidney and lung physiology and further show that LRRK2 kinase function affects LRRK2 protein steady-state levels thereby altering putative scaffold/GTPase activity. These novel aspects of peripheral LRRK2 biology critically impact ongoing attempts to develop LRRK2 selective kinase inhibitors as therapeutics for PD.
28582829	(G2019S) mutation of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the most common genetic cause of both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) cases.  Twelve- to sixteen-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice prepared by us displayed progressive degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopaminergic neurons and parkinsonism phenotypes of motor dysfunction. LRRK2 is a member of mixed lineage kinase subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs). We hypothesized that (G2019S) mutation augmented LRRK2 kinase activity, leading to overphosphorylation of downstream MAPK kinase (MKK) and resulting in activation of neuronal death signal pathway. Consistent with our hypothesis, (G2019S) LRRK2 expressed in HEK 293 cells exhibited an augmented kinase activity of phosphorylating MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4) at Ser(257), and protein expression of active phospho-MKK4(Ser257) was upregulated in the SN of (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice. Protein level of active phospho-JNK(Thr183/Tyr185) and phospho-c-Jun(Ser63), downstream targets of phospho-MKK4(Ser257), was increased in the SN of (G2019S) LRRK2 mice. Upregulated mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic Bim and FasL, target genes of phospho-c-Jun(Ser63), and formation of active caspase-9, caspase-8 and caspase-3 were also observed in the SN of (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice. Our results suggest that mutant (G2019S) LRRK2 activates MKK4-JNK-c-Jun pathway in the SN and causes the resulting degeneration of SNpc dopaminergic neurons in PD transgenic mice."
28582835	Mutations in the genes encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and α-synuclein are associated with both autosomal dominant and idiopathic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). α-Synuclein is the main protein in Lewy bodies, hallmark inclusions present in both sporadic and familial PD. We show that in PD brain tissue, the levels of LRRK2 are positively related to the increase in α-synuclein phosphorylation and aggregation in affected brain regions (amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex), but not in the unaffected visual cortex. In disease-affected regions, we show co-localization of these two proteins in neurons and Lewy body inclusions. Further, in vitro experiments show a molecular interaction between α-synuclein and LRRK2 under endogenous and over-expression conditions. In a cell culture model of α-synuclein inclusion formation, LRRK2 co-localizes with the α-synuclein inclusions, and knocking down LRRK2 increases the number of smaller inclusions. In addition to providing strong evidence for an interaction between LRRK2 and α-synuclein, our results shed light on the complex relationship between these two proteins in the brains of patients with PD and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease.
28582838	Recent studies indicate that the Parkinson's disease-linked leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) modulates cytoskeletal functions by regulating actin and tubulin dynamics, thereby affecting neurite outgrowth. By interactome analysis we demonstrate that the binding of LRRK2 to tubulins is significantly enhanced by pharmacological LRRK2 inhibition in cells. Co-incubation of LRRK2 with microtubules increased the LRRK2 GTPase activity in a cell-free assay.  Destabilization of microtubules causes a rapid decrease in cellular LRRK2(S935) phosphorylation indicating a decreased LRRK2 kinase activity. Moreover, both human LRRK2(G2019S) fibroblasts and mouse LRRK2(R1441G) fibroblasts exhibit alterations in cell migration in culture. Treatment of mouse fibroblasts with the selective LRRK2 inhibitor LRRK2-IN1 reduces cell motility. These findings suggest that LRRK2 and microtubules mutually interact both in non-neuronal cells and in neurons, which might contribute to our understanding of its pathogenic effects in Parkinson's disease."
28582839	Recent genome-wide association studies have linked common variants in the human genome to Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. Here we show that the consequences of variants at 2 such loci, PARK16 and LRRK2, are highly interrelated, both in terms of their broad impacts on human brain transcriptomes of unaffected carriers, and in terms of their associations with PD risk. Deficiency of the PARK16 locus gene RAB7L1 in primary rodent neurons, or of a RAB7L1 ortholog in Drosophila dopamine neurons, recapitulated degeneration observed with expression of a familial PD mutant form of LRRK2, whereas RAB7L1 overexpression rescued the LRRK2 mutant phenotypes. PD-associated defects in RAB7L1 or LRRK2 led to endolysosomal and Golgi apparatus sorting defects and deficiency of the VPS35 component of the retromer complex. Expression of wild-type VPS35, but not a familial PD-associated mutant form, rescued these defects. Taken together, these studies implicate retromer and lysosomal pathway alterations in PD risk."
28582845	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder behind Alzheimer's disease. There are currently no therapies proven to halt or slow the progressive neuronal cell loss in PD. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular causes of PD is needed to develop disease-modifying therapies. PD is an age-dependent disease that causes the progressive death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons results in locomotor symptoms such as slowness of movement, tremor, rigidity and postural instability. Abnormalities in other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, may also be involved in both the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Most cases of PD are sporadic but many families show a Mendelian pattern of inherited Parkinsonism and causative mutations have been identified in genes such as Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, alpha-synuclein and leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2).  Although the definitive causes of idiopathic PD remain uncertain, the activity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) is reduced in PD brains and has been shown to be a key determinant of vulnerability to dopaminergic neuron loss in PD animal models. Furthermore, Gpx1 activity decreases with age in human substantia nigra but not rodent substantia nigra. Therefore, we crossed mice deficient for both Parkin and DJ-1 with mice deficient for Gpx1 to test the hypothesis that loss-of-function mutations in Parkin and DJ-1 cause PD by increasing vulnerability to Gpx1 deficiency. Surprisingly, mice lacking Parkin, DJ-1 and Gpx1 have increased striatal dopamine levels in the absence of nigral cell loss compared to wild type, Gpx1(-/-), and Parkin(-/-)DJ-1(-/-) mutant mice.  Additionally, Parkin(-/-)DJ-1(-/-) mice exhibit improved rotarod performance and have increased serotonin in the striatum and hippocampus. Stereological analysis indicated that the increased serotonin levels were not due to increased serotonergic projections. The results of our behavioral, neurochemical and immunohistochemical analyses reveal that PD-linked mutations in Parkin and DJ-1 cause dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems beyond the nigrostriatal dopaminergic circuit and that loss-of-function mutations in Parkin and DJ-1 lead to adaptive changes in dopamine and serotonin especially in the context of Gpx1 deficiency.
28582846	Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene represent the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, LRRK2 function and molecular mechanisms causing the parkinsonian phenotype remain widely unknown.  Most of LRRK2 knockdown and overexpression models strengthen the relevance of LRRK2 in regulating neurite outgrowth. We have recently identified ARHGEF7 as the first guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of LRRK2. This GEF is influencing neurite outgrowth through regulation of actin polymerization. Here, we examined the expression profile of neuroblastoma cells with reduced LRRK2 and ARHGEF7 levels to identify additional partners of LRRK2 in this process. Tropomyosins (TPMs), and in particular TPM4, were the most interesting candidates next to other actin cytoskeleton regulating transcripts in this dataset. Subsequently, enhanced neurite branching was shown using primary hippocampal neurons of LRRK2 knockdown animals. Furthermore, we observed an enhanced number of growth cones per neuron and a mislocalization and dysregulation of ARHGEF7 and TPM4 in these neuronal compartments. Our results reveal a fascinating connection between the neurite outgrowth phenotype of LRRK2 models and the regulation of actin polymerization directing further investigations of LRRK2-related pathogenesis.
28582847	Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial Parkinson's disease. We found LRRK2 to be degraded in lysosomes by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), whereas the most common pathogenic mutant form of LRRK2, G2019S, was poorly degraded by this pathway. In contrast to the behavior of typical CMA substrates, lysosomal binding of both wild-type and several pathogenic mutant LRRK2 proteins was enhanced in the presence of other CMA substrates, which interfered with the organization of the CMA translocation complex, resulting in defective CMA. Cells responded to such LRRK2-mediated CMA compromise by increasing levels of the CMA lysosomal receptor, as seen in neuronal cultures and brains of LRRK2 transgenic mice, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons and brains of Parkinson's disease patients with LRRK2 mutations. This newly described LRRK2 self-perpetuating inhibitory effect on CMA could underlie toxicity in Parkinson's disease by compromising the degradation of α-synuclein, another Parkinson's disease-related protein degraded by this pathway."
28582850	Mutations in LRRK2 cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain protein containing GTPase and kinase domains, and putative protein-protein interaction domains. Familial PD mutations alter the GTPase and kinase activity of LRRK2 in vitro. LRRK2 is suggested to regulate a number of cellular pathways although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To explore such mechanisms, it has proved informative to identify LRRK2-interacting proteins, some of which serve as LRRK2 kinase substrates. Here, we identify common interactions of LRRK2 with members of the dynamin GTPase superfamily.  LRRK2 interacts with dynamin 1-3 that mediate membrane scission in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and with dynamin-related proteins that mediate mitochondrial fission (Drp1) and fusion (mitofusins and OPA1). LRRK2 partially co-localizes with endosomal dynamin-1 or with mitofusins and OPA1 at mitochondrial membranes. The subcellular distribution and oligomeric complexes of dynamin GTPases are not altered by modulating LRRK2 in mouse brain, whereas mature OPA1 levels are reduced in G2019S PD brains. LRRK2 enhances mitofusin-1 GTP binding, whereas dynamin-1 and OPA1 serve as modest substrates of LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation in vitro. While dynamin GTPase orthologs are not required for LRRK2-induced toxicity in yeast, LRRK2 functionally interacts with dynamin-1 and mitofusin-1 in cultured neurons. LRRK2 attenuates neurite shortening induced by dynamin-1 by reducing its levels, whereas LRRK2 rescues impaired neurite outgrowth induced by mitofusin-1 potentially by reversing excessive mitochondrial fusion. Our study elucidates novel functional interactions of LRRK2 with dynamin-superfamily GTPases that implicate LRRK2 in the regulation of membrane dynamics important for endocytosis and mitochondrial morphology.
28582852	Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is enriched in the striatal projectionneurons (SPNs). We found that LRRK2 negatively regulates protein kinase A (PKA)activity in the SPNs during synaptogenesis and in response to dopamine receptorDrd1 activation. LRRK2 interacted with PKA regulatory subunit IIβ (PKARIIβ). Alack of LRRK2 promoted the synaptic translocation of PKA and increasedPKA-mediated phosphorylation of actin-disassembling enzyme cofilin and glutamate receptor GluR1, resulting in abnormal synaptogenesis and transmission in thedeveloping SPNs. Furthermore, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GluR1 was alsoaberrantly enhanced in the striatum of young and aged Lrrk2(-/-) mice aftertreatment with a Drd1 agonist. Notably, a Parkinson's disease-related Lrrk2R1441C missense mutation that impaired the interaction of LRRK2 with PKARIIβ alsoinduced excessive PKA activity in the SPNs. Our findings reveal a previouslyunknown regulatory role for LRRK2 in PKA signaling and suggest a pathogenicmechanism of SPN dysfunction in Parkinson's disease."
28582855	Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) are associated with familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 is a complex protein that consists of multiple domains executing several functions, including GTP hydrolysis, kinase activity, and protein binding. Robust evidence suggests that LRRK2 acts at the synaptic site as a molecular hub connecting synaptic vesicles to cytoskeletal elements via a complex panel of protein-protein interactions.  Here we investigated the impact of pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity on synaptic function. Acute treatment with LRRK2 inhibitors reduced the frequency of spontaneous currents, the rate of synaptic vesicle trafficking and the release of neurotransmitter from isolated synaptosomes. The investigation of complementary models lacking LRRK2 expression allowed us to exclude potential off-side effects of kinase inhibitors on synaptic functions. Next we studied whether kinase inhibition affects LRRK2 heterologous interactions. We found that the binding among LRRK2, presynaptic proteins and synaptic vesicles is affected by kinase inhibition. Our results suggest that LRRK2 kinase activity influences synaptic vesicle release via modulation of LRRK2 macro-molecular complex.
28582858	Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene cause late-onset, autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). The clinical and neurochemical features of LRRK2-linked PD are similar to idiopathic disease although neuropathology is somewhat heterogeneous. Dominant mutations in LRRK2 precipitate neurodegeneration through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism which can be modeled in transgenic mice overexpressing human LRRK2 variants. A number of LRRK2 transgenic mouse models have been developed that display abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission and alterations in tau metabolism yet without consistently inducing dopaminergic neurodegeneration. To directly explore the impact of mutant LRRK2 on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, we developed conditional transgenic mice that selectively express human R1441C LRRK2 in dopaminergic neurons from the endogenous murine ROSA26 promoter. The expression of R1441C LRRK2 does not induce the degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons or striatal dopamine deficits in mice up to 2years of age, and fails to precipitate abnormal protein inclusions containing alpha-synuclein, tau, ubiquitin or autophagy markers (LC3 and p62). Furthermore, mice expressing R1441C LRRK2 exhibit normal motor activity and olfactory function with increasing age.  Intriguingly, the expression of R1441C LRRK2 induces age-dependent abnormalities of the nuclear envelope in nigral dopaminergic neurons including reduced nuclear circularity and increased invaginations of the nuclear envelope. In addition, R1441C LRRK2 mice display increased neurite complexity of cultured midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Collectively, these novel R1441C LRRK2 conditional transgenic mice reveal altered dopaminergic neuronal morphology with advancing age, and provide a useful tool for exploring the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the R1441C LRRK2 mutation in PD.
28582859	Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been associated with Parkinson's disease(PD) and other disorders. However, its normal physiological functions andpathogenic properties remain elusive. Here we show that LRRK2 regulates theanterograde ER-Golgi transport through anchoring Sec16A at the endoplasmicreticulum exit sites (ERES). LRRK2 interacted and co-localized with Sec16A, a keyprotein in the formation of ERES. Lrrk2 depletion caused a dispersion of Sec16Afrom ERES and impaired ER export. In neurons, LRRK2 and Sec16A showed extensiveco-localization at the dendritic ERES (dERES) that locally regulate the transportof proteins to the dendritic spines. A loss of Lrrk2 affected the association of Sec16A with dERES and impaired the activity-dependent targeting of glutamatereceptors onto the cell/synapse surface. Furthermore, the PD-related LRRK2 R1441Cmissense mutation in the GTPase domain interfered with the interaction of LRRK2with Sec16A and also affected ER-Golgi transport, while LRRK2 kinase activity wasnot required for these functions. Therefore, our findings reveal a newphysiological function of LRRK2 in ER-Golgi transport, suggesting ERESdysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD."
28582861	Converging evidence suggests that the Parkinson's disease-linked leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) modulates cellular function by regulating actin dynamics. In the present study we investigate the role of LRRK2 in functional synaptic terminals of adult LRRK2-knockout and LRRK2(R1441G)-transgenic mice as well as in primary fibroblasts of LRRK2(G2019S) mutation carriers. We show that lack of LRRK2decreases and overexpression of mutant LRRK2 age-dependently increases the effect of the actin depolymerizing agent Latrunculin A (LatA) on the synaptic cytoskeleton. Similarly, endogenous mutant LRRK2 increases sensitivity to LatA in primary fibroblasts. Under basal conditions however, these fibroblasts show an increase in F-actin bundles and a decrease in filopodial length which can be rescued by LatA treatment. Our data suggest that LRRK2 alters actin dynamics and F-actin structure both in brain neurons and skin fibroblasts. We hypothesize that increased F-actin bundling represents a compensatory mechanism to protect F-actin from the depolymerizing effect of mutant LRRK2 under basal conditions. Our data further indicate that LRRK2-dependent changes in the cytoskeleton might have functional consequences on postsynaptic NMDA receptor localization."
28582865	OBJECTIVE: Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) pose a significant genetic risk in familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). R1441 mutation (R1441G/C) in its GTPase domain is found in familial PD. How LRRK2 interacts with synaptic proteins, and its role in dopamine (DA) homeostasis and synaptic vesicle recycling remain unclear.  METHODS: To explore the pathogenic effects of LRRK2(R1441G) mutation on nigrostriatal synaptic nerve terminals and locomotor activity, we generated C57BL/6N mice with homozygous LRRK2(R1441G) knockin (KI) mutation, and examined for early changes in nigrostriatal region, striatal synaptosomal [(3)H]-DA uptake and locomotor activity after reserpine-induced DA depletion.  RESULTS: Under normal conditions, mutant mice showed no differences, (1) in amount and morphology of nigrostriatal DA neurons and neurites, (2) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), DA uptake transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) expression in striatum, (3) COX IV, LC3B, Beclin-1 expression in midbrain, (4) LRRK2 expression in total cell lysate from whole brain, (5) α-synuclein, ubiquitin, and tau protein immunostaining in midbrain, (6) locomotor activity, compared to wild-type controls. However, after a single intraperitoneal reserpine dose, striatal synaptosomes from young 3-month-old mutant mice demonstrated significantly lower DA uptake with impaired locomotor activity and significantly slower recovery from the effects of reserpine.  INTERPRETATION: Although no abnormal phenotype was observed in mutant LRRK2(R1441G) mice, the KI mutation increases vulnerability to reserpine-induced striatal DA depletion and perturbed DA homeostasis resulting in presynaptic dysfunction and locomotor deficits with impaired recovery from reserpine. This subtle nigrostriatal synaptic vulnerability may reflect one of the earliest pathogenic processes in LRRK2-associated PD.
28582869	Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the single most common genetic cause of both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), both of which share pathogenetic and neurologic similarities with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Pathologic LRRK2 activity may also contribute to neuroinflammation, because microglia lacking LRRK2 exposed to proinflammatory stimuli have attenuated responses. Because microglial activation is a hallmark of HIV-1 neuropathology, we have investigated the role of LRRK2 activation using in vitro and in vivo models of HAND. We hypothesize that LRRK2 is a key modulator of microglial inflammatory responses, which play a pathogenic role in both HAND and PD, and that these responses may cause or exacerbate neuronal damage in these diseases. The HIV-1 Tat protein is a potent neurotoxin produced during HAND that induces activation of primary microglia in culture and long-lasting neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity when injected into the CNS of mice. We found that LRRK2 inhibition attenuates Tat-induced pS935-LRRK2 expression, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, and phosphorylated p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase signaling in primary microglia. In our murine model, cortical Tat injection in LRRK2 knock-out (KO) mice results in significantly diminished neuronal damage, as assessed by microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), class III β-tubulin TUJ1, synapsin-1, VGluT, and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining. Furthermore, Tat-injected LRRK2 KO animals have decreased infiltration of peripheral neutrophils, and the morphology of microglia from these mice were similar to that of vehicle-injected controls. We conclude that pathologic activation of LRRK2 regulates a significant component of the neuroinflammation associated with HAND.
28582871	Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of autosomal-dominant forms of Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 is a modular, multidomain protein containing 2 enzymatic domains, including a kinase domain, as well as several protein-protein interaction domains, pointing to a role in cellular signaling. Although enormous efforts have been made, the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of LRRK2 are still not completely known. In this study, we used a chemical genetics approach to identify LRRK2 substrates from mouse brain. This approach allows the identification of substrates of 1 particular kinase in a complex cellular environment. Several of the identified peptides are involved in the regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics, including microtubule-associating protein (MAP)/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 1 (MARK1). MARK1 is a serine/threonine kinase known to phosphorylate MT-binding proteins such as Tau, MAP2, and MAP4 at KXGS motifs leading to MT destabilization. In vitro kinase assays and metabolic-labeling experiments in living cells confirmed MARK1 as an LRRK2 substrate. Moreover, we also showed that LRRK2 and MARK1 are interacting in eukaryotic cells. Our findings contribute to the identification of physiologic LRRK2 substrates and point to a potential mechanism explaining the reported effects of LRRK2 on neurite morphology.
28582878	Lysosomal dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Several genes linked to genetic forms of PD, including leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), functionally converge on the lysosomal system. While mutations in LRRK2 are commonly associated with autosomal-dominant PD, the physiological and pathological functions of this kinase remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that LRRK2 regulates lysosome size, number and function in astrocytes, which endogenously express high levels of LRRK2. Expression of LRRK2 G2019S, the most common pathological mutation, produces enlarged lysosomes and diminishes the lysosomal capacity of these cells. Enlarged lysosomes appears to be a common phenotype associated with pathogenic LRRK2 mutations, as we also observed this effect in cells expressing other LRRK2 mutations; R1441C or Y1699C.  The lysosomal defects associated with these mutations are dependent on both the catalytic activity of the kinase and autophosphorylation of LRRK2 at serine 1292.  Further, we demonstrate that blocking LRRK2's kinase activity, with the potent and selective inhibitor PF-06447475, rescues the observed defects in lysosomal morphology and function. The present study also establishes that G2019S mutation leads to a reduction in lysosomal pH and increased expression of the lysosomal ATPase ATP13A2, a gene linked to a parkinsonian syndrome (Kufor-Rakeb syndrome), in brain samples from mouse and human LRRK2 G2019S carriers. Together, these results demonstrate that PD-associated LRRK2 mutations perturb lysosome function in a kinase-dependent manner, highlighting the therapeutic promise of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors in the treatment of PD.
28582880	Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and tau have been identified as risk factors of Parkinson's disease (PD). As LRRK2 is a kinase and tau is hyperphosphorylated in some LRRK2 mutation carriers of PD patients, the obvious hypothesis is that tau could be a substrate of LRRK2. Previous reports that LRRK2 phosphorylates free tau or tubulin-associated tau provide direct support for this proposition.  By comparing LRRK2 with cdk5, we show that wild-type LRRK2 and the G2019S mutant phosphorylate free recombinant full-length tau protein with specific activity 480- and 250-fold lower than cdk5, respectively. More strikingly tau binds to wt LRRK2 or the G2019S mutant 140- or 200-fold more strongly than cdk5. The extremely low activity of LRRK2 but strong binding affinity with tau suggests that LRRK2 may facilitate tau phosphorylation as a scaffold protein rather than as a major tau kinase. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that (i) cdk5 or tau coimmunoprecipitates with endogenous LRRK2 in SH-SY5Y cells, in mouse brain tissue, and in human PBMCs; (ii) knocking down endogenous LRRK2 by its siRNA in SH-SY5Y cells reduces tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and Ser404; (iii) inhibiting LRRK2 kinase activity by its inhibitors has no effect on tau phosphorylation at these two sites; and (iv) overexpressing wt LRRK2, the G2019S mutant, or the D1994A kinase-dead mutant in SH-SY5Y cells has no effect on tau phosphorylation. Our results suggest that LRRK2 facilitates tau phosphorylation indirectly by recruiting tau or cdk5 rather than by directly phosphorylating tau.
28582884	Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a causative gene for Parkinson's disease, but the physiological function and the mechanism(s) by which the cellular activity of LRRK2 is regulated are poorly understood. Here, we identified p21-activated kinase 6 (PAK6) as a novel interactor of the GTPase/ROC domain of LRRK2. p21-activated kinases are serine-threonine kinases that serve as targets for the small GTP binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 and have been implicated in different morphogenetic processes through remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton such as synapse formation and neuritogenesis. Using an in vivo neuromorphology assay, we show that PAK6 is a positive regulator of neurite outgrowth and that LRRK2 is required for this function. Analyses of post-mortem brain tissue from idiopathic and LRRK2 G2019S carriers reveal an increase in PAK6 activation state, whereas knock-out LRRK2 mice display reduced PAK6 activation and phosphorylation of PAK6 substrates. Taken together, these results support a critical role of LRRK2 GTPase domain in cytoskeletal dynamics in vivo through the novel interactor PAK6, and provide a valuable platform to unravel the mechanism underlying LRRK2-mediated pathophysiology. We propose p21-activated kinase 6 (PAK6) as a novel interactor of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a kinase involved in Parkinson's disease (PD). In health, PAK6 regulates neurite complexity in the brain and LRRK2 is required for its function, (a) whereas PAK6 is aberrantly activated in LRRK2-linked PD brain (b) suggesting that LRRK2 toxicity is mediated by PAK6.
28582890	Most of cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) have a sporadic origin, with their causes mostly unknown, although overexposure to some environmental factors has been found to occur in some cases. Other forms of parkinsonism are the consequence of dominant or recessive mutations in specific genes, e.g.  α-synuclein, parkin and, more recently, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), whose G2019S mutation represents the most prevalent form of late-onset, autosomal dominant familial PD. A transgenic mouse model expressing the G2019S mutation of LRRK2 is already available and apparently may represent a valuable experimental model for investigating PD pathogenesis and novel treatments. We designed a long-term study with these animals aimed at: (i) elucidating the changes experienced by the endocannabinoid signaling system in the basal ganglia during the progression of the disease in these mice, paying emphasis in the CB2 receptor, which has emerged as a promising target in PD, and (ii) evaluating the potential of compounds selectively activating this CB2 receptor, as disease-modifying agents in these mice. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that LRRK2 transgenic mice develop motor impairment consisting of small anomalies in rotarod performance (presumably reflecting a deficit in motor coordination and dystonia) and a strong deficiency in the hanging-wire test (reflecting muscle weakness), rather than hypokinesia which was difficult to be demonstrated in the actimeter. These behavioral responses occurred in absence of any evidence of reactive gliosis and neuronal losses, as well as synaptic deterioration in the basal ganglia, except an apparent impairment in autophagy reflected by elevated LAMP-1 immunolabelling in the striatum and substantia nigra. Furthermore, there were no changes in the status of the CB2 receptor, as well as in other elements of the endocannabinoid signaling, in the basal ganglia, but, paradoxically, the selective activation of this receptor partially reversed the deficits in the hanging-wire test of LRRK2 transgenic mice. This was accompanied by normalization in LAMP-1 immunolabelling in the basal ganglia, although it is possible that other CNS structures, remaining to be identified, are involved in the behavioral improvement. In summary, our data support the interest of the CB2 receptor as a potential pharmacological target in LRRK2 transgenic mice, although the neuronal substrates underlying these benefits might be not completely related to the basal ganglia and to the presumed parkinsonian features of these mice.
28582893	Pathologic inclusions define α-synucleinopathies that include Parkinson's disease (PD). The most common genetic cause of PD is the G2019S LRRK2 mutation that upregulates LRRK2 kinase activity. However, the interaction between α-synuclein, LRRK2, and the formation of α-synuclein inclusions remains unclear. Here, we show that G2019S-LRRK2 expression, in both cultured neurons and dopaminergic neurons in the rat substantia nigra pars compact, increases the recruitment of endogenous α-synuclein into inclusions in response to α-synuclein fibril exposure. This results from the expression of mutant G2019S-LRRK2, as overexpression of WT-LRRK2 not only does not increase formation of inclusions but reduces their abundance.  In addition, treatment of primary mouse neurons with LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, PF-06447475 and MLi-2, blocks G2019S-LRRK2 effects, suggesting that the G2019S-LRRK2 potentiation of inclusion formation depends on its kinase activity.  Overexpression of G2019S-LRRK2 slightly increases, whereas WT-LRRK2 decreases, total levels of α-synuclein. Knockdown of total α-synuclein with potent antisense oligonucleotides substantially reduces inclusion formation in G2019S-LRRK2-expressing neurons, suggesting that LRRK2 influences α-synuclein inclusion formation by altering α-synuclein levels. These findings support the hypothesis that G2019S-LRRK2 may increase the progression of pathological α-synuclein inclusions after the initial formation of α-synuclein pathology by increasing a pool of α-synuclein that is more susceptible to forming inclusions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: α-Synuclein inclusions are found in the brains of patients with many different neurodegenerative diseases. Point mutation, duplication, or triplication of the α-synuclein gene can all cause Parkinson's disease (PD). The G2019S mutation in LRRK2 is the most common known genetic cause of PD. The interaction between G2019S-LRRK2 and α-synuclein may uncover new mechanisms and targets for neuroprotection. Here, we show that expression of G2019S-LRRK2 increases α-synuclein mobility and enhances aggregation of α-synuclein in primary cultured neurons and in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, a susceptible brain region in PD. Potent LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, which are being developed for clinical use, block the increased α-synuclein aggregation in G2019S-LRRK2-expressing neurons. These results demonstrate that α-synuclein inclusion formation in neurons can be blocked and that novel therapeutic compounds targeting this process by inhibiting LRRK2 kinase activity may slow progression of PD-associated pathology.
28582894	Autosomal dominant mutations that activate the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause inherited Parkinson's disease. Recent work has revealed that LRRK2 directly phosphorylates a conserved threonine/serine residue in the effector-binding switch-II motif of a number of Rab GTPase proteins, including Rab10. Here we describe a facile and robust method to assess phosphorylation of endogenous Rab10 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), lung and spleen-derived B-cells, based on the ability of the Phos-tag reagent to retard the electrophoretic mobility of LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10. We exploit this assay to show that phosphorylation of Rab10 is ablated in kinase-inactive LRRK2[D2017A] knockin MEFs and mouse lung, demonstrating that LRRK2 is the major Rab10 kinase in these cells/tissue. We also establish that the Phos-tag assay can be deployed to monitor the impact that activating LRRK2 pathogenic (G2019S and R1441G) knockin mutations have on stimulating Rab10 phosphorylation. We show that upon addition of LRRK2 inhibitors, Rab10 is dephosphorylated within 1-2 min, markedly more rapidly than the Ser(935) and Ser(1292) biomarker sites that require 40-80 min. Furthermore, we find that phosphorylation of Rab10 is suppressed in LRRK2[S910A+S935A] knockin MEFs indicating that phosphorylation of Ser(910) and Ser(935) and potentially 14-3-3 binding play a role in facilitating the phosphorylation of Rab10 by LRRK2 in vivo The Rab Phos-tag assay has the potential to significantly aid with evaluating the effect that inhibitors, mutations and other factors have on the LRRK2 signalling pathway.
28582895	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second common neurodegenerative disease.  Identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of disease progression is important. The present comparative proteomic study of serum samples using two-dimensional fluorescence differential gel electrophoresis followed by ELISA confirmation demonstrated that protein expression of Rab35 was increased in PD patients compared with matched control subjects and other parkinsonian disorders, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The serum level of Rab35 was significantly correlated with the age at onset of PD. The median age of onset in patients with higher Rab35 serum level was 5 years younger than those with lower Rab35 serum level. There was a positive correlation between the Rab35 level and disease duration of PD. Moreover, the protein expression of Rab35 was increased in the substantia nigra but not in the striatum of mouse models of PD, including MPTP-treated mice, rotenone-treated mice, (R1441C) LRRK2 or (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice. Furthermore, overexpression of Rab35 increased the aggregation and secretion of mutant A53T α-synuclein in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. Co-expression of Rab35 with wild-type or A53T α-synuclein in SH-SY5Y cells deteriorated cell death. Our results suggest that Rab35 is potentially useful in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders and is implicated in the pathogenesis of PD.
28582899	BACKGROUND: α-Synuclein (αSYN) has been genetically implicated in familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), and is associated with disease susceptibility, progression and pathology. Excess amounts of αSYN are toxic to neurons. In the brain, microglial αSYN clearance is closely related to neuronal survival.  Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the one of the other genes implicated in familial and sporadic PD. While LRRK2 is known to be expressed in microglia, its true function remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated αSYN clearance by microglia isolated from LRRK2-knockout (KO) mice.  RESULTS: In LRRK2-KO microglia, αSYN was taken up in larger amounts and cleared from the supernatant more effectively than for microglia isolated from wild-type (WT) mice. This higher clearance ability of LRRK2-KO microglia was thought to be due to an increase of Rab5-positive endosomes, but not Rab7- or Rab11-positive endosomes. Increased engagement between Rab5 and dynamin 1 was also observed in LRRK2-KO microglia.  CONCLUSION: LRRK2 negatively regulates the clearance of αSYN accompanied by down-regulation of the endocytosis pathway. Our findings reveal a new functional role of LRRK2 in microglia and offer a new insight into the mechanism of PD pathogenesis.
28582901	INTRODUCTION: Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most prevalent cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Because most pathogenic LRRK2 mutations result in enhanced kinase activity, it suggests that LRRK2 inhibitors may serve as a potential treatment for PD. To evaluate whether LRRK2 inhibitors are effective therapies for PD, it is crucial to know whether LRRK2 inhibitors will affect dopaminergic (DAergic) neurotransmission. However, to date, there is no study to investigate the impact of LRRK2 inhibitors on DAergic neurotransmission.  AIMS: To address this gap in knowledge, we examined the effects of three types of LRRK2 inhibitors (LRRK2-IN-1, GSK2578215A, and GNE-7915) on dopamine (DA) release in the dorsal striatum using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and DA neuron firing in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) using patch clamp in mouse brain slices.  RESULTS: We found that LRRK2-IN-1 at a concentration higher than 1 μM causes off-target effects and decreases DA release, whereas GSK2578215A and GNE-7915 do not. All three inhibitors at 1 μM have no effect on DA release and DA neuron firing rate. We have further assessed the effects of the inhibitors in two preclinical LRRK2 mouse models (i.e., BAC transgenic hG2019S and hR1441G) and demonstrated that GNE-7915 enhances DA release and synaptic vesicle mobilization/recycling.  CONCLUSION: GNE-7915 can be validated for further therapeutic development for PD.
28582902	BACKGROUND: LRRK2 mutations and risk variants increase susceptibility to inherited and idiopathic Parkinson's disease, while recent studies have identified potential protective variants. This, and the fact that LRRK2 mutation carriers develop symptoms and brain pathology almost indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease, has led to enormous interest in this protein. LRRK2 has been implicated in a range of cellular events, but key among them is canonical Wnt signalling, which results in increased levels of transcriptionally active β-catenin. This pathway is critical for the development and survival of the midbrain dopaminergic neurones typically lost in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Here we use Lrrk2 knockout mice and fibroblasts to investigate the effect of loss of Lrrk2 on canonical Wnt signalling in vitro and in vivo. Micro-computed tomography was used to study predicted tibial strength, while pulldown assays were employed to measure brain β-catenin levels. A combination of luciferase assays, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to measure canonical Wnt activity and investigate the relationship between LRRK2 and β-catenin. TOPflash assays are also used to study the effects of LRRK2 kinase inhibition and pathogenic and protective LRRK2 mutations on Wnt signalling. Data were tested by Analysis of Variance. RESULTS: Loss of Lrrk2 causes a dose-dependent increase in the levels of transcriptionally active β-catenin in the brain, and alters tibial bone architecture, decreasing the predicted risk of fracture. Lrrk2 knockout cells display increased TOPflash and Axin2 promoter activities, both basally and following Wnt activation. Consistently, over-expressed LRRK2 was found to bind β-catenin and repress TOPflash activation. Some pathogenic LRRK2 mutations and risk variants further suppressed TOPflash, whereas the protective R1398H variant increased Wnt signalling activity. LRRK2 kinase inhibitors affected canonical Wnt signalling differently due to off-targeting; however, specific LRRK2 inhibition reduced canonical Wnt signalling similarly to pathogenic mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of LRRK2 causes increased canonical Wnt activity in vitro and in vivo. In agreement, over-expressed LRRK2 binds and represses β-catenin, suggesting LRRK2 may act as part of the β-catenin destruction complex. Since some pathogenic LRRK2 mutations enhance this effect while the protective R1398H variant relieves it, our data strengthen the notion that decreased canonical Wnt activity is central to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis."
28582906	Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been identified as an unambiguous cause of late-onset, autosomal-dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and LRRK2 mutations are the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic PD known to date. A number of transgenic mice expressing wild-type or mutant LRRK2 have been described with varying degrees of LRRK2-related abnormalities and modest pathologies. None of these studies directly addressed the role of the kinase domain in the changes observed and none of the mice present with robust features of the human disease. In an attempt to address these issues, we created a conditional LRRK2 G2019S (LRRK2 GS) mutant and a functionally negative control, LRRK2 G2019S/D1994A (LRRK2 GS/DA). Expression of LRRK2 GS or LRRK2 GS/DA was conditionally controlled using the tet-off system in which the presence of tetracycline-transactivator protein (tTA) with a CAMKIIα promoter (CAMKIIα-tTA) induced expression of TetP-LRRK2 GS or TetP-LRRK2 GS/DA in the mouse forebrain. Overexpression of LRRK2 GS in mouse forebrain induced behavioral deficits and α-synuclein pathology in a kinase-dependent manner.  Similar to other genetically engineered LRRK2 GS mice, there was no significant loss of dopaminergic neurons. These mice provide an important new tool to study neurobiological changes associated with the increased kinase activity from the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, which may ultimately lead to a better understanding of not only the physiologic actions of LRRK2, but also potential pathologic actions that underlie LRRK2 GS-associated PD.
28582910	Characterization of the LRRK2 Transcript. At the onset of this study LRRK2 was a largely predicted gene with an unknown potential for alternative ORFs, promoters, or exon splicing. To determine the correct and predominant LRRK2 transcript as it exists in human tissue, we performed adapter-mediated 5′ RACE using cDNA derived from human brain. Reverse oligonucleotides positioned in the predicted first, third, or fifth exon of LRRK2 revealed multiple transcription initiation sites (Fig. 1A and Fig. 7, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). In the brain, at least six transcription start sites are present between 48 and 120 bp upstream of the first predicted Kozak sequence. A single and distinct transcription initiation site downstream of the first predicted exon (within intron 1) excludes the complete LRRK2 ORF (Fig. 1B). However, the transcript does not correlate to an obvious ORF that would produce protein of appreciable size. Therefore, the biological significance of this transcript remains unknown. No evidence of alternate LRRK2 exons or protein coding sequence was identified. We verified the presence of endogenous LRRK2 transcript in human tissue and HEK-293T cells by using RT-PCR with oligonucleotide primers situated on the 3′ end of LRRK2 mRNA (Fig. 1C).Next, the exon structure and potential for alternative splicing within LRRK2 was determined in mRNA derived from human substantia nigra tissue. Using oligonucleotides positioned in the identified 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of LRRK2, full-length LRRK2 transcript (≈7.5 kb) was sequentially amplified and subcloned into a plasmid library (pCR2.1). Twenty clones containing LRRK2 were isolated and examined for alternative splicing by using PCR and sequence analysis. In all 20 clones from this tissue source, 51 exons were present. A cryptic splice site found between exons 50 and 51 (within intron 50) in 3 of 20 clones results in the exclusion of 6 aa near the WD40 domain. Thus, no prevalent alternative splicing in LRRK2 occurs in this tissue source although a cryptic splice site likely produces an alternate LRRK2 protein isoform with a partially altered amino acid sequence near the C terminus.Expression of LRRK2 in Cell Lines. The complete LRRK2 ORF was subcloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3.1 in frame with a C-terminal myc-His tag, and the resultant amino acid sequence was compared with the current Entrez database entry for LRRK2 (accession no. AAV63975). Deviations in LRRK2 amino acid sequence used in this study include a Thr for Met at position 2397, corresponding to a common nonsynonomous polymorphism with a heterozygousity near 0.5 (dbSNP accession no. rs3761863). In addition, a Leu is present at position 212 in contrast to Ser; however, the sequence encoding a Ser was not detected in human DNA despite sequencing over 1,000 European cases and controls for the underlying polymorphism (S.B., unpublished observations).Plasmid containing full-length LRRK2 was transiently transfected into HEK-293T cells and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against either the C-terminal myc tag or three peptide-derived LRRK2 antibodies raised against two distinct regions of the N terminus (JH5517 and JH5518) or the C terminus (JH5514). A single protein corresponding to LRRK2 (≈280 kDa) is detected in transfected cells in addition to several crossreactive proteins apparent in both transfected and nontransfected cells (Fig. 1D). Despite the presence of endogenous LRRK2 transcript in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 1C), no endogenous LRRK2 protein of the appropriate size is apparent by Western blot using the antibodies described here. Similarly, endogenous LRRK2 protein appears expressed at very low levels in adult human brain or whole mouse brain (data not shown).Subcellular Localization of Overexpressed WT and Mutant LRRK2. Mutations in several genes related to neurodegeneration have previously been described to alter cellular localization and hence function of the encoded protein. To determine the cellular localization of overexpressed WT LRRK2 as well as LRRK2 harboring the G2019S and R1441C mutations, transfected HEK-293T cells were imaged by using confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A). Subcellular fractionation performed on cells overexpressing WT or mutant LRRK2 were separated into fractions enriched in cytoplasmic, nuclear, and mitochondrial proteins with successful enrichment assessed by relevant marker proteins (Fig. 2B). Transient expression of either WT or mutant LRRK2 is similar in cells compared with marker proteins. LRRK2 is largely excluded from the nucleus and present in a diffuse organization in the cytosol (Fig. 2 A and B). A significant amount (≈10%) of total LRRK2 is associated with the P10 mitochondrial-enriched fraction. The subcellular distribution of LRRK2 is similar in transfected SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown).To determine whether LRRK2 is associated with the inside or outside of mitochondria, cell lysate enriched in cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins was partially digested with trypsin before fractionation. In this scenario, DJ-1, a known mitochondrial protein that is present in both the matrix and intermembrane space (14), is protected from digestion, whereas LRRK2 is completely digested (Fig. 2C). In addition, the mitochondrial outer-transmembrane protein porin is largely unaffected by brief trypsin exposure as opposed to LRRK2, which implies that LRRK2 is associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria but is unlikely to enter mitochondria. The G2019S and R1441C mutations have no robust effect on steady-state levels or cellular distribution.Metabolism of WT and Mutant LRRK2. Familial-PD-linked mutations in the α-synuclein gene, DJ-1gene, and PINK1 gene may adversely affect protein turnover contributing to the pathogenesis of PD (15). To determine whether mutations in LRRK2 may affect protein turnover, transiently transfected SH-SY5Y cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 or the lysosomal degradation inhibitor ammonium chloride (Fig. 3A). Whereas inhibition of the lysosomal degradation pathway has no effect on LRRK2 turnover, treatment with proteasome inhibitors results in the accumulation of LRRK2 (≈2-fold over 24 h) and the appearance of higher-molecular-weight LRRK2, which may correspond to polyubiquitinated protein. To determine whether LRRK2 is ubiquitinated under normal cellular conditions in SH-SY5Y cells, myc-tagged WT LRRK2 was cotransfected with or without HA-tagged ubiquitin followed by treatment with or without MG-132. Analysis of immunprecipitates confirmed the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to LRRK2 upon proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3B) consistent with polyubiquitination. As expected, ubiquitination of LRRK2 was less pronounced in the absence of MG-132, which is consistent with the idea that the proteasomal turnover of LRRK2 is mediated, at least in part, by polyubiquitination. Experiments using cycloheximide-chase assays to assess protein turnover demonstrate a long but equivalent half-life (>12 h) for WT and mutant LRRK2 in cell lines (data not shown). Thus, familial-linked mutations have no appreciable effect on the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal turnover of LRRK2. Experiments were repeated using HEK-293T cells with similar results (data not shown).Kinase Activity of WT and Mutant LRRK2. LRRK2 encodes a kinase domain with highest similarity to the MLK motif found in proteins that commonly have both Ser/Thr and Tyr kinase activity. PD-linked mutations in LRRK2 have previously been suggested to affect intrinsic kinase activity, thereby leading to disease (16). To assess the kinase activity of WT and mutant LRRK2, we derived microgram quantities of recombinant LRRK2 at high purity by immunoprecipitation as assessed by silver stain (Fig. 4A). We next developed a kinase assay to measure the ability of WT or mutant LRRK2 to phosphorylate biotinylated MBP. Kinase buffer conditions were first optimized to increase the ratio of LRRK2-mediated phosphorylated MBP versus both background and nonspecific phosphorylation (Fig. 8, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). In preliminary experiments, kinase reaction conditions previously reported for MLK activity also induced the highest level of LRRK2 kinase activity (Fig. 8, buffer C). Interestingly, buffer compositions previously used for other tyrosine kinases or Ser/Thr kinases performed poorly in activity assays, and assays using the tyrosine kinase-specific substrate poly(Glu)tyrosine revealed low but significant levels of LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation (data not shown), consistent with the assignment of LRRK2 as an MLK.The amount of WT or mutant LRRK2 protein per kinase reaction was directly assessed by Western blotting, thereby normalizing the amount of phosphorylated MBP to the amount of LRRK2 in each experiment (Fig. 4B). Background and nonspecific phosphorylation was subtracted from all reactions containing LRRK2 by using immunoprecipitated myc-tagged DJ-1 protein as a negative control (data not shown). The G2019S mutant LRRK2 had significantly greater phosphorylation activity than WT protein (P< 0.05). In addition, we observed a trend toward increased kinase activity of R1441C mutant LRRK2 compared with WT; however, despite repeated experiments, the trend was not significant (P < 0.1, Fig. 4B). Recombinant LRRK2 was unable, under the conditions described here, to appreciably phosphorylate other recombinant proteins with importance in PD including parkin, MAPT, and α-synuclein in preliminary in vitro kinase assays.Autophosphorylation Activity of WT and Mutant LRRK2. Using the same buffer and reaction conditions as in kinase activity assays with MBP, we measured the ability of recombinant LRRK2 protein to phosphorylate itself in the absence of any potential cofactors or activators. The amount of phosphorylated LRRK2 was normalized to the amount of input LRRK2 protein as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5). Similar to experiments using MBP as a substrate, the G2019S mutant LRRK2 protein demonstrates increased autophosphorylation activity compared with WT protein (Fig. 5C). In these experiments, the R1441C mutation (located outside of the MLK domain) has significantly increased autophosphorylation activity versus WT protein. No other phosphorylation signals were apparent in these experiments, suggesting the absence of contaminating protein kinases, cofactors, or substrates in our immunoprecipitated LRRK2 preparations."
28582911	LRRK2 Expression and Kinase ActivityTo investigate the normal and pathological functions of LRRK2, we generated plasmid vectors for overexpression of wild-type or disease-associated mutant alleles of LRRK2 including G2019S, I2020T, Y1699C, and R1441G (Figures 1A and 1B). A V5/His-epitope tag was added to the amino terminus of each coding sequence to distinguish the plasmid-encoded protein from endogenous LRRK2. Plasmids were transiently transfected into COS7 cells, and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibodies specific for the V5 epitope tag or LRRK2. A single 280 kDa protein was observed in cytoplasmic lysates of cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant LRRK2 plasmids, and transfection of LRRK2plasmids led to a minor increase in expression over the normal endogenous level (less than 2-fold; Figure 1B and Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available online).Lysates from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated using an antibody for the V5 epitope tag, and subsequently the immunoprecipitated complexes were assayed for kinase activity toward purified myelin basic protein (MBP) or myosin light chain (MLC), common substrates for mixed-lineage kinase-related proteins. Wild-type LRRK2 displayed a low level of kinase activity in this assay, whereas the G2019S mutation led to significantly increased kinase activity toward both MBP and MLC (Figure 1B and Figure S1B). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the G2019S mutation leads to disinhibited kinase activity relative to wild-type LRRK2(Gloeckner et al., 2005, West et al., 2005).Additionally, two short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based plasmid vectors were generated to inhibit the expression of endogenous rodent LRRK2 by RNA interference (RNAi; see Experimental Procedures). Transfection of either of these plasmids into primary rat cortical cultures or rat C6 glioma cells led to a reduction in the level of LRRK2mRNA and protein to less than 20% of baseline levels, as determined by real-time quantitative rtPCR, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry with polyclonal antibodies for LRRK2 (Figure 1C and Figures S1C and S1D). Immunocytochemical analysis of primary cortical cultures further revealed the presence of LRRK2throughout the soma and neurite processes of neurons (Figure 1C). Immunocytochemistry with antibodies for the polyhistidine epitope tag or for LRRK2indicated that plasmid-encoded wild-type and G2019S mutant LRRK2 localized similarly to the endogenous protein (Figure S2). The G2019S LRRK2 mutant protein was also present in distinctive spheroid-like inclusions within cellular processes and at intracellular membranous structures (see below).LRRK2 Regulates Neuronal Process MorphologyPrimary cortical cultures were transfected with plasmid vectors encoding wild-type or mutant forms of V5 epitope-tagged LRRK2 (or vector control), along with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) sequences to allow for the identification of transfected cells (~5% of neurons; data not shown).Overexpression of either of two clinically associated missense mutant forms of LRRK2 within the kinase domain, G2019S and I2020T, led to a dramatic reduction in neurite length and branching evident with respect to both the longest neuronal processes, corresponding to axons, as well as total neurite outgrowth (Figures 1D and 1E and Figure S2C). This was confirmed by antibody staining for axonal and dendritic markers (Figure S3A). Neuronal polarity, as quantified by the ratio of axons to dendrites, appeared unaltered. Overexpression of a Parkinsonism-associated missense mutation in the ROC domain, R1441G, also led to a significant decrease in process length, whereas a mutation within the COR domain, Y1699C, induced a relatively modest decrease in process length that did not reach statistical significance (Figures 1D and 1E). Overexpression of wild-type LRRK2 did not alter neuronal morphology, and the soma size of neurons transfected with either wild-type (wt) or mutant LRRK2 allele cDNA appeared similar to vector control.As Parkinsonism-associated LRRK2 alleles display disinhibited kinase activity and short processes, we hypothesized that neurons deficient in LRRK2 activity may demonstrate extended processes. First, we generated an additional mutant form of LRRK2, K1906M, that is predicted to lie within the ATP-binding segment of the kinase domain (Cobb and Goldsmith, 1995) and has been shown to generate a dominant-negative allele (Cobb and Goldsmith, 1995, Gloeckner et al., 2005). Overexpression of the K1906M allele led to a significant increase in total process length, an effect that was particularly evident with respect to the length of the longest process (Figures 1D and 1E). In a second approach, LRRK2 accumulation was inhibited by RNAi. Cortical neurons transfected with either of two shRNA vectors specific for LRRK2 displayed a prominent increase in neurite length (Figures 1D and 1E and data not shown).LRRK2 Mutations and the Maintenance of Neuronal ProcessesTo distinguish between a role in the generation and the maintenance of process length, we performed a time course analysis of neuronal morphology in cortical cultures transfected with LRRK2 wild-type, G2019S, or I2020T vectors, or with the LRRK2 knockdown shRNA vector. Individual cells were followed by fluorescence microscopy at 6, 9, 12, and 15 days subsequent to transfection. This time course analysis demonstrated that overexpression of PD-associated LRRK2 mutants G2019S or I2020T, but not wild-type LRRK2, led to a progressive decline in the length and branching of neurite processes (Figure 2A and Figure S3B). In contrast, soma diameter was not significantly reduced in the mutant LRRK2 transfected neurons. Time course analysis of LRRK2 shRNA-mediated knockdown in cortical neuron cultures indicated a gradual and progressive increase in neurite process length (Figure 2A).At late time points, decreased neuron survival was evident in neurons that express the Parkinsonism-associated LRRK2 mutant alleles. By day 15 posttransfection, survival was significantly reduced in mutant LRRK2 transfected cortical neurons in comparison to wild-type or vector-only transfected cells, as determined by exclusion of propidium iodide staining and lack of nuclear condensation (45% survival in the G2019S versus 90% in the wild-type or vector transfected cells; p < 0.05; Figures 2B and 2C). Immunocytochemistry for activated caspase-3 demonstrated that the mutant LRRK2 G2019S-transfected cells undergo an apoptotic mechanism of cell death (Figure S3C).Structure/Function Analysis of LRRK2 Reveals a Critical Role for the Kinase DomainTo establish a structure/function relationship of LRRK2 domains, we sought to “rescue” the shRNA knockdown allele phenotype by overexpression of LRRK2cDNA sequences. Transfection of the LRRK2 shRNA vector along with overexpression of wild-type LRRK2 sequences effectively rescues the elongated process morphology phenotype (Figure 2D and Figure S3D). Interestingly, the kinase domain alone is sufficient for functional rescue of the knockdown shRNA phenotype. Deletion analysis revealed that the kinase domain alone is also sufficient for the shortened neurite phenotype in the context of Parkinsonism-associated LRRK2 G2019S allele expression (Figure 2E). Finally, analysis of the phenotype of primary midbrain cultures showed that LRRK2 expression similarly regulates neurite process morphology in dopamine neurons (Figure S4).LRRK2 Mutations Induce tau-Positive Spheroid Axonal Inclusions In VitroProminent spheroid-like aggregates were observed within the neuronal processes in all of the G2019S (37 out of 37) and I2020T (20 out of 20) transfected cortical neurons, but only rarely in vector alone (3 out of 85) or wild-type LRRK2 (4 out of 45) transfected cells, as determined by fluorescence microscopy for the eGFP marker (Figures 3A and 3B). The inclusions stained positively with a monoclonal antibody for the His epitope-tagged G2019S LRRK2 protein. tau protein phosphorylated at serine 202 (phospho-tau), visualized by immunostaining with a phospho-specific antibody, appeared to accumulate specifically in the spheroidal inclusions, but these structures did not stain positively with an antibody for αSyn (Figure 3A and Figure S5).Ultrastructural analyses by electron microscopy revealed that neurons expressing the LRRK2 G2019S mutant allele, but not control vector, display abnormal accumulation of abundant electrodense structures suggestive of swollen lysosomes (Figures 3C and 3D). Additionally, multivesicular bodies (MVBs), distended mitochondria associated with vacuoles, and disrupted cytoskeletal structures are observed. Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemical analysis and confocal microscopy of neurons expressing the G2019S LRRK2 allele revealed prominent membranous structures that stain with antibodies for the lysosomal markers LAMP1 (Figure 4E) and cathepsin D (data not shown). A time course analysis revealed that the inclusions appear by day 6 posttransfection, coincident with the neurite process phenotype (Figure S3D).LRRK2 Mutation in Adult Nigral Dopamine NeuronsWe further analyzed LRRK2 function in adult rat substantia nigra dopamine neurons (DNs) using an adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV-2)-mediated gene transduction model. As the kinase domain of LRRK2 is sufficient to induce the G2019S-associated cellular phenotypes in vitro (Figure 2D), and because of the genome size limitation of viral vectors, we overexpressed the kinase domain alone of either wild-type or G2019S mutant LRRK2. AAV-2 vectors were stereotactically injected into the substantia nigra pars compacta within the ventral midbrain of young adult rats along with GFP vector to allow visualization of transduced cells. After 1 month, rats were sacrificed, and histological examination of the brain was performed. All analyses were performed by an observer blinded to the animal genotype. In the context of G2019S overexpression, and with wild-type LRRK2 overexpression to a lesser extent, dopaminergic axonal processes extending into the striatum displayed prominent abnormal morphology and inclusions (as identified by GFP expression and TH immunostaining; Figures 4A and 4B, n = 8 for each group), consistent with the in vitro phenotype. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the inclusions stained positively for phospho-tau (at serine 404) but not for αSyn (Figure 4A and Figure S6). Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra appeared grossly normal in the context of G2019S LRRK2 expression, but apoptosis was significantly increased, as quantified by nuclear morphology and immunohistochemistry for activated caspase-3 (Figures 4A and 4B and Figure S6). Overexpression of the wild-type kinase domain alone led to the induction of some axonal inclusions, but to a lesser extent than the G2019S mutant.LRRK2 Regulates Neurite Process Morphology in the CNSAxonal processes appeared to be reduced in complexity in the context of G2019S expression relative to vector control in the adult rat gene transduction model (Figure S6C), but this was difficult to quantify due to the high density of neuronal processes in the intact CNS. To circumvent this, we used a technique that allows for the marking of individual genetically altered neurons within an otherwise normal CNS environment: in utero intracerebral gene transduction of rat embryos by vector injection into the lateral ventricles. Genetic manipulation of neuronal progenitors within the periventricular cell layer of E16 rat embryos can be achieved by either plasmid vector electroporation or lentiviral transduction (Tsai et al., 2005). After a 5 day period in utero, the embryos (E21) are sacrificed, and brain sections are visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Electroporation of vector alone labels neuronal cells throughout layers 1 and 2 of the cerebral cortex that appear morphologically as neurons and are immunostained with a neuronal marker, Tuj1 (Figure S6D). Overexpression of PD-associated mutant LRRK2 alleles, G2019S or I2020T, dramatically reduced both the length and the branching of neuronal processes, relative to control vector (Figures 4C and 4D), consistent with the phenotype observed in neuronal primary cultures. In contrast, cortical neurons transduced with LRRK2 shRNA display a significant increase in the number of branch points relative to control vector-transduced cells (Figures 4C and 4D). Also, total axon length appeared to be increased in the knockdown cells, although this did not reach statistical significance. In summary, LRRK2 appears to regulate neuronal process morphology in the intact CNS, consistent with the primary culture analysis"
28582912	LRRK2 forms a complex with Hsp90 in vivoTo investigate how the G2019S mutation in LRRK2 causes neuronal dysfunction in vivo, we generated a conditional transgenic mouse model in which the expression of C-terminal HA-tagged human LRRK2 was under the control of a tetracycline-responsive regulator. The expression of mutant LRRK2 protein was detected in the forebrain after having been crossed with CaMKII—tTA transgenic mice (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Using a HA affinity column, we purified LRRK2-associated protein complexes from transgenic mouse brains to identify any proteins that might interact with mutant LRRK2 in vivo. Proteins specifically present in mutant mouse brains, including LRRK2 and a pair of proteins with an apparent molecular weight of ~90 kDa, were identified by silver staining (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry revealed that these 90 kDa proteins were two splice variants of Hsp90: Hsp90α and Hsp90β. The appearance of Hsp90 in the LRRK2-containing protein complex was further confirmed by immunoblot analysis with an Hsp90-specific antibody after immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged LRRK2 from transgenic mouse brains (Fig. 1B). This observation that LRRK2 forms a complex with Hsp90 in vivo is consistent with previous in vitro studies (Gloeckner et al., 2006; Dachsel et al., 2007).Hsp90 functions in concert with a set of cochaperones that link Hsp90 to distinct classes of client proteins (Pearl and Prodromou, 2006). The mammalian homolog of the yeast cell cycle control protein Cdc37 acts as a kinase-specific target subunit for Hsp90. Cdc37 was also coimmunoprecipitated with LRRK2 (Fig. 1C). Other cochaperones, including Hsp70, Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (HOP), and p23, however, did not show the same interaction with LRRK2 (Fig. ​(Fig.1D,1D, ​,2A2A).Hsp90 inhibitor disrupts the formation of the LRRK2/Hsp90 complexThe chaperone activities of Hsp90 are ATP dependent. GA, which interferes with the association of Hsp90 and ATP, specifically inhibits Hsp90 chaperone activity in cells (Chiosis et al., 2004). To examine whether the formation of the LRRK2/Hsp90 complex depends on Hsp90 chaperone activity, we immunoprecipitated LRRK2 from LRRK2-transfected HEK-293 cells after a short treatment with GA (1 μm). We found that treatment of GA effectively disrupted the coimmunoprecipitation of both WT and G2019S mutant LRRK2 with endogenous Hsp90 and Cdc37 in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 2). These data demonstrate that the formation of the LRRK2/Hsp90 complex is dependent on the chaperone activity of Hsp90. Interestingly, more constitutive heat shock protein 70 (Hsc70) was pulled down with LRRK2 after treatment of GA. Because Hsc70 is involved in protein folding, the dissociation of LRRK2 with the Hsp90-mediated chaperone complex likely results in misfolding of LRRK2 and more binding of LRRK2 with Hsc70-mediated chaperone complex.Inhibition of Hsp90 reduces the steady level of LRRK2 expression in cell linesHsp90 is known to regulate the function and stability of many protein kinases (Sreedhar et al., 2004). To investigate whether the activity of Hsp90 is required for the stability of LRRK2, we transfected WT and G2019S mutant LRRK2 into HEK-293 cells and treated the transfected cells with Hsp90 specific inhibitor PUH71 at different doses. Similar to GA, purine-scaffold derivative PU-H71 also disrupts the association of Hsp90 with ATP, resulting in inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone activity (Rodina et al., 2007). Furthermore, whereas GA activity could be modulated by a reductive environment in the cell, resulting in effects that are not a direct consequence of Hsp90 inhibition (Kelland et al., 1999), PU-H71 is not metabolically sensitive to the cellular environment (Rodina et al., 2007). Both G2019S (Fig. 3A) and WT LRRK2 (Fig. 3B) displayed a comparable sensitivity to PU-H71-mediated Hsp90 inhibition in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3C) (IC50-G2019S of 130.0 nm vs IC50-WT of 112.0 nm, n = 4; p = 0.86). Similar results were also obtained when WT and G2019S LRRK2-transfected HEK-293 cells were treated with GA and another Hsp90 inhibitor, PU-DZ8 (data not shown).To investigate whether Hsp90 inhibitors generally suppress the overall steady level of protein expression in cells, we examined the expression of human α-synuclein A53T in transfected HEK-293 cells after treatment with 500 nm GA. Consistent with previous observations (Auluck and Bonini, 2002; Klucken et al., 2004; Auluck et al., 2005; Flower et al., 2005), the steady level of α-synuclein expressed in transfected HEK-293 cells was not affected by Hsp90 inhibition (Fig. 3D).Inhibition of Hsp90 reduces the steady level of mutant and endogenous LRRK2 in cultured neuronsTo investigate whether the activity of Hsp90 is required for the stability of LRRK2 in neurons, we examined the expression of LRRK2 in primary cultured cortical neurons derived from nontransgenic (ntg) and LRRK2 G2019S mutant pups after treatment with Hsp90-specific inhibitors. Treatment of neurons with GA suppressed the steady levels of both mutant and endogenous LRRK2 expression in both a dose-dependent (Fig. 4A) and time-dependent (Fig. 4B) manner. It appears that the exogenous G2019S LRRK2 was more sensitive to GA treatment than endogenous protein (Fig. 4C) (IC50-G2019S of 4.7 nm, 95% CI of 1.6–13.6 nm vs IC50-endogenous of 37.2 nm, 95% CI of 11.8–117.5 nm, n = 4; p < 0.05). Similarly, the suppression of LRRK2 expression was also observed when neurons were treated with PU-H71 (Fig. 4D) (IC50-G2019S of 26.9 nm, 95% CI of 8.3–87.2 nm vs IC50-endogenous of 387.0 nm, 95% CI of 144.9–1000 nm, n = 4; p < 0.0001). The increased sensitivity of G2019S mutation to Hsp90 inhibition is likely a result from the greater expression of mutant LRRK2 in neurons (supplemental Fig. 1 B, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In line with this notion, heterologous expression of WT and G2019S LRRK2 in HEK-293 cells had a comparable sensitivty to Hsp90 inhibition (Fig. 3C). These observations suggest that the alteration of the apparent IC50 of Hsp90 inhibitors is attributable to increased expression levels rather than an LRRK2 mutation. Nonetheless, lower concentrations of GA and PU-H71 could be used to selectively suppress the expression of G2019S mutant but not endogenous LRRK2 protein in neurons derived from LRRK2 transgenic mice.To investigate whether Hsp90 inhibitors interfere with the transcription of the LRRK2 gene, the expression of mutant and endogenous LRRK2 messenger RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR in vehicle- and GA-treated neurons. No significant difference between expression of mutant and endogenous LRRK2messenger RNA was found (data not shown), suggesting that Hsp90 inhibitors suppress the LRRK2 expression via inhibition of the chaperone activities of Hsp90 rather than interference with the transcription of LRRK2.Hsp90 regulates the stability of LRRK2To investigate whether Hsp90 plays a role in maintaining the stability of LRRK2 in cells, we examined the t1/2 of both WT and G2019S mutant LRRK2 proteins in transfected HEK-293 cells after treatment with 1 μm PU-H71 (Fig. 5A). The t1/2 for untreated WT and G2019S mutant LRRK2 were comparable (Fig. 5B,C)(t1/2-WT of 8.66 h, 95% CI of 5.22–25.30 h vs t1/2-G2019S of 8.51 h, 95% CI of 4.94–30.81 h; r2 = 0.96; n= 2). Meanwhile, the t1/2 of WT and G2019S mutant LRRK2 proteins in PU-H71-treated cells were significantly reduced compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 5B, C)(t1/2-WT of 0.75 h, 95% CI of 0.49–1.59 h vs t1/2-G2019S of 0.83 h, 95% CI of 0.54–1.73 h; r2 = 0.95; n = 2). These data demonstrate that Hsp90 is critical for maintaining the stability of both WT and mutant LRRK2 in cells.The Hsp90 inhibitor-induced suppression of LRRK2 expression is mediated by the proteasome-dependent protein degradation pathwayHsp90 client proteins tend to be degraded via the proteasome-dependent pathway during chaperone inhibition (Goryunov and Liem, 2007). Concordantly, the GA-induced suppression of mutant and endogenous LRRK2 was selectively blocked by a protea-some inhibitor, MG132, but not the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine in neurons (Fig. 6A, B). These observations demonstrate that LRRK2, like other Hsp90 client proteins, are stabilized by Hsp90 against proteasome-mediated protein degradation.Hsp90 inhibitor rescues the axonal outgrowth deficits of neurons expressing the LRRK2 G2019S mutationA previous report indicates that LRRK2 is involved in maintaining the extension and branching of neurites (MacLeod et al., 2006). Mutant LRRK2, particularly the G2019S mutation but not wild-type LRRK2, causes neurite shortening via a potential autophagy-mediated pathway (Plowey et al., 2008). Consistent with this observation, we recently found that neurons derived from LRRK2 G2019S transgenic mouse brains also displayed retarded axonal outgrowth during neuron morphogenesis (C. Xie, unpublished data). To determine whether Hsp90 inhibitors are capable of rescuing the axonal growth deficit in LRRK2 G2019S transgenic neurons by suppressing mutant LRRK2 expression, we treated the neurons with PU-H71 immediately after they were plated onto culture dishes. We used PU-H71 at 40 nm, which significantly suppressed the expression of mutant LRRK2 but had a minimal effect on endogenous LRRK2 (Fig. 4D). The length of axons, the longest neurites, of vehicle-treated mutant neurons (G2019S) was significantly shorter than that of ntg littermate controls after 2d in culture (Fig. 7A, B,E) (lengthG2019S of 68.30 ± 2.73 μm, n = 79 vs lengthntg of 93.75 ± 4.87 μm, n = 48; p < 0.001). PU-H71 significantly increased the length of axons of mutant neurons compared with treatment with vehicle (Fig. 7D,E) (lengthG2019S/H71 of 112.47 ± 7.04 μm, n = 45; p < 0.001). As a positive control, treatment with Dox, which suppresses the expression of mutant LRRK2 through the tetracycline responsible regulator, also rescued the axon growth defect of mutant neurons (Fig. 7C,E) (lengthG2019S/Dox of 96.58 ± 4.09 μm, n = 62; p < 0.001). In contrast, no significant alteration of axon length was detected in vehicle-, Dox-, and PU-H71-treated nontransgenic neurons (Fig. 7F). These results demonstrate that Hsp90 inhibitors can ameliorate mutant LRRK2-elicited loss of axonal outgrowth."
28582915	Generation of LRRK2 and α-synuclein inducible transgenic miceAs described previously (Wang et al., 2008), we have generated LRRK2 inducible transgenic mice in which the expression of carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human wild-type (WT), G2019S, or kinase-deletion (KD) mutant LRRK2 was under the transcriptional control of tetracycline operator (tetO) (Figure 1A). To make the KD expression construct, we deleted residues from 1887 to 2102 of LRRK2, resulting in a complete deletion of its kinase domain. In parallel with the generation of LRRK2 inducible transgenic mice, we also used the same strategy to generate new lines of human α-synuclein (α-syn) A53T inducible transgenic mice (tetO-A53T). Given the expression pattern of LRRK2 (Galter et al., 2006) is similar to that of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-alpha (CaMKII) in the brain, we crossbred tetO-LRRK2 and tetO-A53T mice with a line of CaMKII promoter-controlled tetracycline transactivator (tTA) (CaMKII-tTA) mice (Mayford et al., 1996) to achieve high level expression of LRRK2or α-syn in the forebrain regions. Accordingly, our previous in situ hybridization experiments showed that the expression of human LRRK2 was mainly detected at the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum in the brain of tetO-LRRK2 and CaMKII-tTA double transgenic mice (Wang et al., 2008). For simplicity, we will later refer to the tetO-LRRK2 and CaMKII-tTA double transgenic mice as LRRK2WT, G2019S, and KD transgenic mice, respectively. We generated five independent lines of LRRK2WT, three independent lines of G2019S, and three independent lines of KD transgenic mice. We refer to the E3 line as the G2019S transgenic mice and the C74 line as the LRRK2 WT expression line (LRRK2WT) in later studies. In both G2019S and LRRKWT mice, the expression of LRRK2 protein was increased by about 8 to 16-fold compared to the endogenous one (Figure 1B, Supplemental Figure S1B). Additionally, we designate line C77 as the LRRK2 WT low expression line (LRRK2WT-L) and line D10 as the KD mice. In the brain homogenate of KD mice, a doublet of LRRK2-positive bands was detected in which the lower one likely represents the exogenous human LRRK2 with truncated kinase domain (Figure 1B). The expression level of exogenous human LRRK2 between LRRK2WT-L and KD transgenic mice was comparable, which was about 8 to 16-fold less than that of LRRK2WT mice (Supplemental Figure S1C). Therefore, the expression of LRRK2 was only modestly increased (< 1-fold) in the brain of LRRK2WT-Land KD mice as compared to nTg controls (Figure 1B). Q-RT-PCR was used to quantify the expression of exogenous LRRK2 in the brain of LRRK2WT-L and KD mice. The transcription of exogenous LRRK2mRNA was about 5 and 15-fold increase in the brain of LRRK2WT-L and KD mice as compared to nTgcontrols (Supplemental Figure S1D). The rather lower accumulation of exogenous LRRK2 protein in the KD mouse brain may likely reflect the instability of this mutant protein.Under the same transcriptional activation of CaMKII promoter-controlled tTA, the expression pattern of human α-syn was the same as that of LRRK2 transgene in the brain (Figure 1C, upper panel). Administration of doxycycline (DOX) suppressed the expression of exogenous α-syn in this “tet-off” system (Figure 1C, middle panel). The expression level of human A53T α-syn protein was increased by about 30-fold as compared to endogenous protein (Figure 1D, Supplemental Figure S1B). Noticeably, under the CaMKII promoter only a small fraction (<5%) of midbrain DA neurons expressed the transgene (Supplemental Figures. S1E–G). Therefore, we focus our studies on the cortex and striatum where the exogenous α-syn and LRRK2 are widely expressed.G2019S inducible transgenic mice developed similar locomotor abnormalities as A53Ttransgenic miceAll lines of LRRK2WT, G2019S, and KD transgenic mice were viable and developed normally. G2019Smice appeared to gain less body weight compared to non-transgenic (nTg) and tetO-G2019S single transgenic mice starting at 12 months of age (Supplemental Figure S2A, p < 0.0001). However, no significant difference in body weight was found between G2019S and CaMKII-tTA mice (Supplemental Figure S2A). The motor functions of G2019S mice were examined by Rotarod and Open-field tests. G2019S mice performed normally in the Rotarod test (Supplemental Figure S2C). However, they displayed significantly increased ambulatory activities starting at 12 months of age (Figure 1E, p < 0.05). G2019S mice also showed a trend of increased rearing activities, but it did not reach the statistic significance (Figure 1G). In addition, there were no apparent motor phenotypes detected in LRRK2WT mice up to 6 months of age (Supplemental Figure S2F–H). By contrast, A53T transgenic mice weighted significantly less starting at 4 months of age (Supplemental Figure S2B, p < 0.0005), and began to display drastic increases of ambulatory activities at 2 months of age (Figure 1F, p < 0.0001) and elevated rearing activities at 6 months of age (Figure 1H, p < 0.05). Together, the motor behavioral studies suggest that over-expression of G2019S LRRK2 and A53T α-syn in the forebrain regions may induce a similar damage to the neural circuitry responsible for regulating motor activities.A53T inducible transgenic mice developed progressive neuropathological abnormalities compared to G2019S transgenic miceTo determine if any neuropathological abnormalities developed in A53T and G2019S transgenic mice, we examined the brain sections of mutant and control animals for neurodegeneration and associated astrocytosis and microgliosis. The neurodegeneration was revealed by Jade C and cleaved-caspase 3 staining. The presence of reactive astrocytes was examined by staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The morphology of microglia was visualized by staining for ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba1). Both Jade C and c-caspase 3 staining were negative in the brain sections derived from 20-month old G2019S transgenic mice (Figures 2Ad, 2Bd; Table 1). Consistently, stereological studies revealed no significant changes in neuron counts at both the frontal cortex and dorsal striatum between G2019S and age-matched nTg mice (Figure 2E–G). In addition, no apparent increase of reactive astrocytosis or microglial activation was observed in the striatum and cortex of G2019S transgenic mice as compared to control nTg animals (Figure 2; Table 1 and Table 2). Similarly, no obvious gross neuropathological phenotypes were found in 12-month old LRRK2WT transgenic mice (Table 1, Supplemental Figures S2I–L).No apparent neuropathological abnormalities were detected in the striatum of 3-month old A53T mice (Figures 2Aa–2Da). Such neuropathology became obvious when A53T transgenic mice were examined at 12 and 20 months of age (Figure 2; Table 1 and Table 2). Widespread neurodegeneration was evident in the brains of 20-month old A53T transgenic mice (Figures 2Ac–2Bc, 2E). Massive neuronal loss in the frontal cortex (>80%) and dorsal striatum (>74%) of A53T mice was estimated by unbiased stereological approaches (Figures 2F–G). Therefore, A53T mice developed age-dependent, progressive neruodegeneration; whereas, G2019S mice did not show any obvious gross neuropathological phenotypes.LRRK2 accelerated the progression of A53T α-syn-mediated neuropathologyTo test whether over-expression of LRRK2 affects A53T α-syn-mediated neurodegeneration, we generated A53T/LRRK2WT-L, A53T/LRRK2WT, A53T/G2019S and A53T/KD double transgenic mice and examined the progression of neuropathological alterations (Figure 3). Compared to 1-month old A53T single transgenic mice, the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes was significantly elevated in the striatum of age-matched A53T/LRRK2WT-L and A53T/LRRK2WT double transgenic mice (Figures 3A, 3E). In addition, more GFAP-positive astrocytes were found in the brain of A53T/LRRK2WT mice than A53T/LRRK2WT-Lmice (Figures 3A, 3E), suggesting that the expression level of LRRK2 influences the progression of α-syn-mediated neuropathology. A similar increase of microglial activation was also observed in A53T/LRRK2WT-L and A53T/LRRK2WT double transgenic mice (Figures 3B, Table 2). Besides gliosis, neurodegeneration was also accelerated in the striatum of A53T/LRRK2WT-L and A53T/LRRK2WTtransgenic mice (Figure 3, Table 1). Co-staining of caspase 3 with Ctip2, a specific marker for striatal medium-size spiny neurons (MSN) (Arlotta et al., 2008), revealed that most of these degenerating neurons were MSNs (Supplemental Figure S3). The prevalence of neurodegeneration in A53T/LRRK2WT double transgenic mice was also elevated in a LRRK2 dose-dependent fashion (Figure 3F, Table 1). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that over-expression of LRRK2 accelerates the progression of α-syn-mediated neuropathology.Since the G2019S mutation in LRRK2 causes late onset PD, we decided to investigate whether the G2019S mutation would further enhance the neuropathology in A53T/G2019S mice as compared to A53T/LRRK2WT double transgenic mice. A significant exacerbation of astrocytosis, microgliosis, and neurodegeneration was observed in the striatum of A53T/G2019S mice as compared with age-matched A53T single transgenic animals (Figure 3; Table 1 and Table 2). When we compared the pathological phenotypes of 1-month old A53T/LRRK2WT and A53T/G2019S mice, we found the number of Jade C-positive and GFAP-positive cells, and the activation of microglia were significantly increased in the striatum of A53T/G2019S mice as compared to A53T/LRRK2WT animals (p < 0.0001, 0.005, and 0.002, respectively; Figure 3E; Table 1 and Table 2). However, when we compared the numbers of neurons remained in the striatum of A53T/LRRK2WT and A53T/G2019S mice, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.14, Figure 3F). To further investigate whether the kinase domain of LRRK2 is critical in regulating α-syn A53T-mediated neuropathology, we compared the progression of neuropathology between A53T/KD and A53T/LRRK2WT-L transgenic mice. As shown in Figure 3, the presence of kinase-deletion LRRK2 also accelerated A53T-mediated neuropathology to a similar extent as LRRK2WT-L (Figure 3 and Table 1–Table 2). These data suggest that the kinase domain of LRRK2 perhaps is not critical in modulating A53T-induced neuropathological abnormalities.We further examined the neurodegeneration of A53T, A53T/LRRK2WT, and A53T/G2019S mice at 6 months of age (Figures 3G–H). While no obvious neuronal loss was observed in both LRRK2WT and G2019S mice, a significant reduction (30%) of striatal neurons was found in A53T single transgenic mice (Figures 3G–H, p < 0.02). More dramatic neuronal loss was detected in the dorsal striatum of A53T/LRRK2WT (80%) and A53T/G2019S (85%) mice (Figures 3G–H, p < 0.001 and 0.0001). However, the numbers of residual neurons in the dorsal striatum of A53T/LRRK2WT and A53T/G2019S mice were not statistically different (p = 0.45, Figure 3H). These observations from adult mice further support our earlier findings that the presence of excess WT and G2019S LRRK2 exacerbates A53T-mediated neurodegeneration and the expression level of LRRK2 rather the PD-related G2019S mutation perhaps is more important in accelerating A53T α-syn-mediated pathogenesis.With the concern whether over-expression of any exogenous protein could accelerate α-syn-mediated neuropathology, we crossbred A53T mice with a line of green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice that selectively express GFP in striatal neurons (Gong et al., 2003). We did not observe any significant influence of GFP on the progression of neuropathology in A53T/GFP double transgenic mice (Figure 3E, Supplemental Figure S4). In addition, to test if LRRK2 selectively potentiates A53T-mediated neuropathology, we crossbred G2019S mice with amyloid precursor protein (APP) inducible transgenic mice in which an Alzheimer’s disease-related double mutant version of chimeric mouse/human APP is over-expressed 10 to 30-fold compared to the endogenous APP (Jankowsky et al., 2005). We found that LRRK2 did not accelerate APP-mediated astrocytosis and microgliosis in APP/G2019S double transgenic mice (Supplemental Figure S5). Together, these observations support a specific effect of LRRK2 on the pathogenesis of α-syn A53T mutation.LRRK2 promoted the abnormal accumulation of α-syn in cell bodiesThe α-syn staining is normally confined to axon terminals (Maroteaux et al., 1988), which was shown here as small puncta in the coronal striatal sections of 3-month old A53T mice and 20-month old nTg mice (Figure 4). Interestingly, a few neurons with strong α-syn staining in the cell body were detected in the brain sections of 12-month old A53T mice (Figures 4B, 4F). The occurrence of this abnormal somatic accumulation of α-syn was more prominent in the brain sections of 20-month old A53T mice (Figures 4C, 4G; Table 3), which was closely correlated with the progression of neurodegeneration in A53Tmice, suggesting that the somatic accumulation of α-syn may trigger the pathogenic cascades leading to the cell death. We then investigated whether over-expression of LRRK2 affects the subcellular distribution of α-syn. No obvious α-syn staining was found in the cell body of striatal neurons in 1 month-old A53T mice (Figure 4I). However, co-expression of LRRK2 G2019S mutation greatly promoted the accumulation of α-syn in the soma of A53T/G2019S neurons in 1-month old mice (Figures 4J–L; Table 3). Similarly, increasing numbers of neurons with somatic accumulation of α-syn were detected in brain sections of 1-month old A53T/LRRK2WT-L, A53T/LRRK2WT and A53T/KD transgenic mice in a LRRK2 dose-dependent manner (Figure 4M–4P; Table 3). To investigate whether over-expression of LRRK2 G2019S mutation also promotes the accumulation of WT α-syn in the cell bodies, we examined the α-syn staining in brain sections from 20-month old G2019S mice and 1-month old human α-syn WT and G2019S double transgenic mice (α-synWT/G2019S). No apparent α-syn staining was detected in the soma of neurons in G2019S and α-synWT single transgenic mice (Supplemental Figure S6). By contrast, somatic staining of α-syn was apparent in neurons of 1-month old α-synWT/G2019S double transgenic mice (Supplemental Figure S6). These results suggest that the LRRK2-induced somatic accumulation of α-syn is independent of the presence of PD-related α-syn mutation but relies on the expression level of α-syn.The staining of LRRK2 seemed to partially overlap with that of α-syn in the soma (Figures 4L, 4P). However, co-immunoprecipitation experiments failed to pull down LRRK2 and α-syn together from brain homogenates of A53T/G2019S and A53T/LRRK2WT mice (unpublished data). In addition, a few neurons, which showed obvious α-syn staining in the soma, were lack of substantial expression of LRRK2 transgene (asterisk, Figures 4L, 4P). These observations suggest that LRRK2 may not directly bind to α-syn and prevent its trafficking to the axon terminals.LRRK2 promoted the formation of α-syn aggregatesTo examine if increased somatic accumulation of α-syn correlates with the formation of α-syn aggregates, we compared the levels of α-syn protein in total and sequentially detergent-extracted fractions of brain homogenates from 1 and 12-month old A53T transgenic mice. The formation of α-syn aggregates was detected as α-syn-positive high molecular weight (HMW) bands in the total brain homogenates of A53Tmice (Figure 5). Interestingly, the intensity of HMW bands was significantly enhanced in the samples of 12-month old A53T mice as compared to 1-month old animals (Figure 5A). We then examined the presence of α-syn aggregates in the Triton X100-insoluble (TX-insol) fractions of brain extracts. While the level of Triton X100-soluble (TX-sol) α-syn was comparable between these two age groups, a significant increase of TX-insol HMW α-syn was found in the samples of 12-month old A53T mice (Figure 5B). These data indicate the accumulation of α-syn in the soma may favor the formation of α-syn aggregates or vise versa.Since over-expression of LRRK2 promoted the somatic accumulation of α-syn, we reasoned that LRRK2may also promote the aggregation of α-syn. We therefore compared the level of HMW α-syn in the total brain lysates of 1-month old A53T and age-matched A53T/G2019S transgenic mice. A modest increase of HMW α-syn was detected in the A53T/G2019S samples (Figure 5C). Similarly, significantly more α-syn was detected in the TX-insoluble fraction of brain homogenates from A53T/G2019S transgenic mice (Figures 5D–E, p = 0.033). Together, these observations indicate that G2019S LRRK2 promotes the formation of α-syn aggregates in neurons.To test if α-syn is a potential substrate of LRRK2’s kinase activity, we examined the phosphorylation of α-syn in total brain homogenates derived from one-month old A53T and A53T/G2019S transgenic mice (Figures 5D–E). Unexpectedly, we observed a reduction of α-syn phosphorylation at serine 129 in the brain lysate of double transgenic mice compared with that of A53T single transgenic animals (p = 0.001). This observation indicates that α-syn is unlikely to be a physiological substrate of LRRK2’s kinase activity in vivo. Secreted α-syn is also implied in the pathogenesis of PD (Lee et al., 2005). To investigate if LRRK2 affects the secretion of α-syn, we measured the level of α-syn in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) by ELISA. We found no significant alteration of secreted α-syn in A53T/G2019S double transgenic mice as compared to A53T single transgenic mice (data not shown).Co-expression of LRRK2 and A53T led to severe fragmentation of Golgi complex in neuronsRecent studies indicate that over-expression of either WT or PD-related mutant α-syn disrupts ER-Golgi traffic and causes Golgi fragmentation (Cooper et al., 2006;Gosavi et al., 2002). Interestingly, LRRK2 is associated with Golgi apparatus (Biskup et al., 2006). We therefore decided to examine the ER and Golgi structures in neurons of A53T and LRRK2 single and double transgenic mice. There was no apparent change of ER structure in these neurons as revealed by calnexin staining (data not shown). However, the structure of Golgi complex was drastically altered in neurons of 1-month old A53T/LRRK2 double transgenic mice (Figure 6). The morphology of Golgi apparatus was examined by GM130 and GLG1 staining, which recognizes cis and medial/trans-Golgi apparatus respectively. GM130 staining revealed tubular structures largely stacked at one side of neurons in 1-month old nTg and A53T mice (arrows, Figures 6A, 6D), which was classified as “Normal” Golgi. The GM130-positive tubules, however, appeared thinner and fragmented in neurons of LRRK2WT and G2019S mice (Figures 6B–C). When A53T was co-expressed with either WT or G2019S LRRK2, severe fragmentation of cis-Golgi was found (asterisk, Figures 6E–F), which was designed as “Fragmented” Golgi thereafter; and the partially fragmented Golgi was referred as “Intermediate” Golgi. Interestingly, the degree of Golgi apparatus fragmentation was correlated with the somatic accumulation of α-syn in these neurons (asterisks, Figures 6H–I). By contrast, neurons that lacked substantial α-syn staining in the soma displayed fairly normal appearance of cis-Golgi network (arrows, Figures 6E–F, Figures 6H–I). The prevalence of cis-Golgi fragmentation was quantified, which showed a significant decrease of “Normal” Golgi in LRRK2single and A53T/LRRK2 double transgenic neurons as compared to nTg controls (Figure 6P). Meanwhile, the ratio of “Fragmented” Golgi was significantly elevated in neurons of A53T/LRRK2 double transgenic mice (Figure 6P). We also examined the integrity of cis-Golgi network in striatal neurons of 6-month old animals and observed a similar fragmentation of GM-130-posotive Golgi apparatus in LRRK2WT, G2019S, and A53T/LRRK2 double transgenic neurons (Supplemental Figure S7). Interestingly, a significant increase of Golgi fragmentation was observed in neurons of 6-month old A53T mice (Supplemental Figure S7).We then checked the structural integrity of medial/trans- Golgi in neurons of A53T and LRRK2 mutant mice. In control nTg mice, GLG1 staining revealed the “Normal” perinuclear and polarized localization of Golgi stacks in neurons (arrows, Figure 6J). However, GLG1-staining was significantly altered in LRRK2WT, G2019, and A53T neurons and was shown as tubular structures scattered around the nucleus (arrowheads, Figures 6K–M). In A53T/LRRK2WT and A53T/G2019S neurons, with a few exceptions (arrowheads, Figures 6N–O,), the GLG1-staining was dispersed as small puncta or became indistinguishable from the background staining (asterisks, Figures 6N–O). We classified these dispersed structures as “Fragmented” Golgi. The ratio of “Fragmented” trans-Golgi was calculated, which was significantly increased in A53T and LRRK2 single and double transgenic neurons as compared to nTgcontrols (Figure 6Q). Increased fragmentation of Golgi apparatus was also observed in neurons of KD and A53T/KD mice (Figures 6P–Q). Together these observations demonstrate that over-expression of LRRK2and α-syn severely disrupted the structure of Golgi apparatus, which may impair the ER/Golgi trafficking and contribute to the somatic accumulation of α-syn.Over-expression of LRRK2 perturbed the dynamics of microtubule assembly in LRRK2and A53T/LRRK2 transgenic miceMicrotubule and microtubule-based intracellular transport play a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of Golgi apparatus (Thyberg and Moskalewski, 1999). LRRK2 has been shown to physically interact with both α and β tubulin through its GTPase domain (Gandhi et al., 2008;Gillardon, 2009). Consistently, we found that both WT and G2019S LRRK2 co-stained with βIII tubulin in the soma and proximal processes of striatal neurons in 1 and 6-month old LRRK2 single and A53T/LRRK2 double transgenic mice (Figure 7; Supplemental Figure S8). A significant overlap of somatic α-syn and βIII tubulin staining was also observed in neurons of 6-month old A53T single transgenic mice (Supplemental Figure S8) as well as in neurons of 1 and 6-month old A53T/LRRK2WT and A53T/G2019S double transgenic mice (Figures 7Dc–Dd, Supplemental Figure S8). These observations were consistent with the previous report that prefibrillar cytoplasmic α-syn interacts with tubulin in cell cultures (Lee et al., 2006).To reveal the functional impact of LRRK2 over-expression on the dynamics of microtubule organization, we compared the level of β-tubulin in both the Reassembly High-salt Buffer (RAB)-soluble and insoluble fractions of mouse brain homogenates from 1-month old A53T, LRRK2WT and G2019S single, and A53T/LRRK2 double transgenic animals as well as nTg controls (Figures 7G–I). RAB buffer is generally used to extract intracellular free tubulin and cold-labile microtubules from brain homogenates (Weingarten et al., 1975). A dramatic reduction of β-tubulin was observed in the RAB-soluble (RAB-S) fraction of brain homogenates in LRRK2WT, G2019S, and A53T/LRRK2 transgenic mice as compared to nTg controls and A53T single transgenic mice (Figures 7G–H). Concomitantly, more β-tubulin was found in the RAB-insoluble pellets (RAB-P) of LRRK2 over-expressing mouse brains as compared to nTg and A53T samples (Figures 7G, 7I). The total level of β-tubulin, meanwhile, was comparable among all different genotypes (Supplemental Figure S9). The distribution of α-tubulin followed the same pattern as β-tubulin in the RAB-extracted brain homogenates from LRRK2 transgenic mice (data not shown). Taken together, these findings are consistent with previous in vitro assays that over-expression of LRRK2 may enhance the polymerization of tubulin in cells (Gillardon, 2009), suggesting that the impairment of microtubule assembly may affect the organization of microtubule network in the cell, resulting in the fragmentation of Golgi apparatus.Over-expression of LRRK2 and A53T impaired ubiquitin-proteasome system in both A53Tand LRRK2 transgenic miceα-syn aggregates have been shown previously to impair the proteasomal and lysosomal activities that leads to accumulation of ubiquinated proteins in cells (Cuervo et al., 2004;Tanaka et al., 2001). Consistently, an elevation of ubiquitin (Ubi) staining was observed in the soma and nucleus of cortical neurons from 6-month old A53T mice (arrows, Figure 8Aa) but not from nTg controls (Figure 8Ae). The Ubi staining was partially overlapped with α-syn (Figure 8Ca). The pattern of Ubi staining was altered in 20-month old A53T mice, which displayed a punctuated staining pattern at neuron processes with no apparent co-localization with α-syn staining (arrowheads, Figures 8Ab, 8Cb). In the presence of excess WT LRRK2, a slightly more α-syn and Ubi-positive clusters were observed in brain sections of 6-month old A53T/LRRK2WT mice (arrowheads, Figure 8Bc). Interestingly, the presence of G2019S seemed to alter the Ubi-staining pattern to a more perinuclear location in neurons of A53T/G2019S mice (arrow, Figure 8Ad).We then examined the Ubi staining in LRRK2 transgenic mice. The level of Ubi staining was increased in cortical neurons of 6-month old LRRK2WT and G2019S mice (Figure 8D). Interestingly, the occurrence of Ubi-positive clusters was more prominent in G2019S neurons (arrowheads, Figure 8D). These Ubi-positive clusters appeared co-stained with LRRK2 in G2019S neurons (arrowheads, Figure 8F). This phenomenon became more apparent in neurons of 20-month old G2019S mice in which LRRK2 and Ubi staining were tightly co-localized as clusters (arrowheads, Figure 8Fe). Moreover, the presence of A53T α-synaccelerated the clustering of LRRK2 staining in neurons of A53T/G2019S mice (arrowheads, Figures 8Ed, 8Fd) as compared to age-matched G2019S mice (Figures 8Dc, 8Fc). In contrast, no obvious LRRK2-positive clusters were found in neurons of 6-month old LRRK2WT and A53T/LRRK2WT mice (Figures 8Da–b, 8Fa–b). Taken together, these observations indicate that G2019S LRRK2 may further inhibit UPS activities, resulting in more frequent formation of LRRK2 and Ubi-positive aggregates in neurons of aged G2019S mice (Figures 8De, 8Ee). Our studies also indicate that the presence of A53T α-syn and G2019S LRRK2 may cause synergistic impairment of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) activities, which further accelerates the formation of LRRK2/Ubi-positive aggregates in neurons of A53T/G2019S double transgenic mice (Figures 8Dd, 8Ed).In parallel with immunohistological studies, we also checked the levels of ubiquitinated proteins in brain homogenates of A53T, LRRK2WT, G2019S, A53T/LRRK2WT, and A53T/G2019S mice by Western blots (Figure 8G). A significant elevation of ubiquitination was observed in the brain homogenate of 3-month old A53T and A53T/LRRK2WT mice as compared to age-matched nTg, LRRK2WT, and G2019S mice (Figure 8H). The level of ubiquitination, however, was only moderately increased in the brain samples of 18-month old G2019S mice compared to age-matched nTg controls (Figures 8G–H).LRRK2 exacerbated mitochondrial structural and functional abnormalities in neurons of A53T transgenic miceMitochondrial dysfunction has been shown in cell and mouse models over-expressing PD-related mutant α-syn (Hsu et al., 2000;Martin et al., 2006). We examined the morphology of mitochondria in striatal neurons of 1-month old mice by EM and found distinctive structural changes in some of the mitochondria in A53Tand A53T/G2019S neurons. Compared to nTg and G2019S samples, the matrix of these abnormal mitochondria was denser (large arrows in Figures 9C–D, 9G–H), and the cristae became widened (small arrows in Figure 9G). The frequency of such abnormal mitochondria was 52/1000 µm2 in striatal area of A53T mice and ~3.5 times higher in A53T/G2019S double transgenic mice (184/1000 µm2); whereas virtually none was found in age-matched nTg or G2019S transgenic mice (Figures 9A–D). The abnormal mitochondria were preferentially distributed in dendrites/soma, with only a few in axon terminals (unpublished data). The mitochondrial structural abnormalities were also confirmed by immunostaining with an antibody against cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein (supplemental Figure S10).To address whether the morphological abnormalities affect the function of mitochondria in striatal neurons of 1-month old A53T and A53T/G2019S transgenic mice, we infused the animal with MitoSox Red, a fluorescent dye for detecting the surplus of mitochondrial superoxide released to the matrix (Robinson et al., 2006). MitoSox Red signal was easily detected in the brain of A53T/G2019S transgenic mice and was more prominent in the dorsal lateral striatum (Figures 9L–M), where most neurodegeneration was found. In contrast, only a few MitoSox Red-positive neurons were found in the stratum of A53T mice (arrowhead, Figure 9K) and no positive staining was detected in nTg or G2019S transgenic mice (Figures 9I–J). These results suggest that co-expression of α-syn and LRRK2 cause synergistic toxicity to mitochondria.Inhibition of LRRK2 expression ameliorated α-syn-mediated neuropathologySince over-expression of LRRK2 accelerated the progression of α-syn-induced neuropathological abnormalities, we decided to investigate whether inhibition of LRRK2 expression was able to alleviate the pathogenesis of mutant α-syn. To inhibit LRRK2 expression, we generated LRRK2 knockout (LRRK2−/−) mice (Supplemental Figure S11). LRRK2−/− mice were viable, fertile, and displayed no obvious motor behavioral phenotypes (Supplemental Figure S12). No apparent elevation of reactive astrocytosis, neurodegeneration, or somatic accumulation of α-syn was found in brains of 20-month old LRRK2−/− mice (Supplemental Figure S12; Table 1–Table 3). Furthermore, the levels of α-syn in Triton-X100 insoluble fraction appeared comparable between LRRK2+/+ and LRRK2−/− mice, indicating no apparent α-syn aggregates were formed in LRRK2−/− mouse brains (data not shown). Compared to littermate controls, only a moderate increase of activated microglia (Supplemental Figure S12; Table 2) was observed in the brain of 20-month old LRRK2−/− mice.To generate A53T mice in the LRRK2 knockout background (A53T/LRRK2−/−), we intercrossed tetO-A53T/LRRK2+/− and CaMKII-tTA/LRRK2+/− mice to get A53T/LRRK2−/−and littermate control mice. The neuropathology of A53T/LRRK2−/− mice and littermate controls was examined at 6 and 12 months of age (Supplemental Figure S13; Figure 10). Similar to A53T/LRRK2+/+ mice, 12-month old A53T/LRRK2+/−mice also displayed significant neurodegeneration, astrocytosis, microgliosis, somatic accumulation of α-syn and severe fragmentation of Golgi apparatus in the striatum (Figure 10). In contrast, no apparent neurodegeneration was found in the striatum of age-matched littermate A53T/LRRK2−/− mice (Figure 10Ab; Table 1). The number of residual neurons in the striatum of 12-month old A53T/LRRK2−/− is also significantly more as compared to age-matched A53T/LRRK2+/− and A53T/LRRK2+/+ mice (Figure 10F). Moreover, no significant elevation of astrocytosis, microgliosis, or somatic accumulation of α-syn was detected in the striatum of 12-month old A53T/LRRK2−/− mice (Figure 10; Table 2 and Table 3). GLG1 staining revealed normal morphology and distribution of Golgi apparatus in neurons of A53T/LRRK2−/−mice (Figures 10Eb, 10J). Similar rescuing effects were also observed in the brain of 12-month old A53T/LRRK2+/+ mice treated with doxycycline (A53T/DOX) (Figure 10). Stereological analyses further revealed significant reduction of neurodegeneration in A53T/DOX mice as compared to age-matched A53T/LRRK2+/+ mice (Figure 10F). In addition to immunohistological analyses, Western blots revealed a significant decrease of HMW α-syn in the total brain homogenates of A53T/LRRK2−/− mice as compared to age-matched A53T/LRRK2+/− mice (Figures 10G, 10I). By contrast, only a moderate decrease of HMW-Ubi was observed in A53T/LRRK2−/− samples (Figure 10G), which did not reach statistical significance by the densitometry analysis. Together these findings demonstrated that inhibition of LRRK2 expression successfully ameliorated α-syn-mediated neuropathological abnormalities in A53T transgenic mice."
28582917	Association of LRRK2 with 14-3-3We employed quantitative SILAC-based MS to identify proteins associated with immunoprecipitates of stably expressed full-length GFP–LRRK2 (Figure 1A), as well as the GFP–LRRK2(G2019S) mutant (Figure 1B), derived from HEK-293 cells. The top hits, which were enriched at 10–30-fold higher levels with GFP–LRRK2 or GFP–LRRK2(G2019S) compared with GFP alone, comprised various isoforms of 14-3-3 (Figure 1). The two other major interactors observed were two isoforms of the Hsp90 chaperone associated with its kinase-specific targeting CDC37 (cell division cycle 37) subunit (enriched 5–15-fold). Hsp90 and CDC37 associated with both wild-type LRRK2 and the LRRK2(G2019S) mutant, and have been reported previously to interact with LRRK2 [15]. No other significant interactors of LRRK2 were detected in this screen.We found that endogenous 14-3-3, as well as Hsp90, was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous LRRK2 from Swiss 3T3 cells (Figure 2A). We also observed that endogenous LRRK2 was co-immunoprecipitated with an antibody that recognizes endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms from Swiss 3T3 cells (Figure 2B). Plasmids encoding expression of seven isoforms of human 14-3-3 were transfected into HEK-293 cells stably expressing full-length FLAG–LRRK2. Following affinity purification, apart from the atypical σ isoform, all other isoforms of 14-3-3 interacted with FLAG–LRRK2 (Figure 2C). As a control we also demonstrated that all 14-3-3 isoforms except 14-3-3σ interacted with endogenous MARK3, a previously characterized 14-3-3 interactor [16].14-3-3 isoforms mostly interact with specific phosphorylated residues on their binding partners [17,18]. To verify whether association of 14-3-3 with LRRK2 was dependent on phosphorylation, we incubated endogenous LRRK2 (Figure 2D) or overexpressed FLAG–LRRK2 (Figure 2E) in the presence or absence of λ phosphatase. λ phosphatase markedly reduced interaction of 14-3-3 with LRRK2 assessed using the overlay assay. This effect was suppressed by the inclusion of the λ phosphatase inhibitor EDTA in the assay (Figures 2D and and2E).2E). Residual binding of 14-3-3 to LRRK2 following λ phosphatase treatment is presumably due to incomplete dephosphorylation of LRRK2.Mapping of major phosphorylation sites on endogenous LRRK2To determine which phosphorylated residue(s) mediate binding to 14-3-3, we performed detailed phospho-peptide Orbitrap MS analysis of endogenous LRRK2 immunoprecipitated from mouse Swiss 3T3 cells (Figure 3A). This revealed three clear phosphorylation sites, namely Ser860, Ser910 and Ser935 (Figure 3B). These residues lie in the N-terminal non-catalytic region of LRRK2 just prior to the leucine-rich repeats (Figure 3C). We also analysed phosphorylation of overexpressed full-length human FLAG–LRRK2 expressed in HEK-293 cells, which confirmed that Ser860, Ser910 and Ser935 were major sites of phosphorylation (Figures 3A and and3B).3B). In addition, we found three other phosphorylation sites in the overexpressed human FLAG–LRRK2 preparation, namely Ser955, Ser973 and Ser976 (Figures 3B and and3C).3C). The phospho-peptides encompassing Ser955, Ser973 and Ser976 were also detected in our analysis of endogenous LRRK2, but owing to the lower abundance of these peptides, we were unable to assign the exact phosphorylation sites (results not shown).￼Phosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935 mediates 14-3-3 binding, but does not control kinase activityWe observed that mutation of Ser860, Ser955, Ser973, Ser976 or both Ser973/Ser976 phosphorylation sites to an alanine residue did not affect binding of 14-3-3 to full-length FLAG–LRRK2 (Figure 3D). Strikingly, however, mutation of Ser910 and/or Ser935 to an alanine residue abolished 14-3-3 interaction, indicating that phosphorylation of both of these residues is necessary for binding of LRRK2 to 14-3-3 isoforms (Figure 3D). Mutation of Ser910 and/or Ser935 or any of the other identified phosphorylation sites did not affect LRRK2 protein kinase activity (Figure 3D). To study whether phosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935was sufficient to mediate interaction with 14-3-3 isoforms, we generated a di-phosphorylated biotinylated peptide encompassing Ser910 and Ser935. We observed that when this was conjugated to streptavidin–agarose, it efficiently affinity-purified 14-3-3 isoforms from HEK-293 cell extracts (Figure 3E). Incubation of this peptide with λ phosphatase to dephosphorylate Ser910 and Ser935 prevented interaction with 14-3-3 isoforms, an effect that was not observed when the λ phosphatase inhibitor EDTA was included (Figure 3E).Generation of Ser910 and Ser935 phospho-specific antibodiesWe next generated phospho-specific antibodies recognizing LRRK2 phosphorylated at Ser910 or Ser935. These antibodies were specific, as mutation of Ser910 to an alanine residue ablated recognition of LRRK2 with an anti-phospho-Ser910 antibody and, similarly, mutation of Ser935 abolished recognition with the anti-phospho-Ser935 antibody (Figure 3F). We consistently observed that mutation of Ser910 to an alanine residue reduced phosphorylation of Ser935 approx. 2-fold and the similar mutation of Ser935 reduced phosphorylation of Ser910 approx. 2-fold as quantified by the Odyssey system (Figure 3F). Utilizing these antibodies, we demonstrate that endogenous LRRK2 immunoprecipitated from mouse brain, kidney and spleen was phosphorylated at Ser910, as well as Ser935, and also bound 14-3-3 (Figure 3G).Sequence alignments indicate that the Ser910 and Ser935 sites, as well as residues surrounding them, are highly conserved in mammalian species (Figure 3H). This region encompassing Ser910 and Ser935 is not present in Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster LRK-1, or, indeed, mammalian LRRK1. Comparison of the residues surrounding Ser910 and Ser935 indicates some striking similarities (Figure 3I, i.e. basic residues at the −3 and −4 positions, a serine residue at the −2 position, an asparagine residue at the −1 position and a large hydrophobic residue at the +1 position).Disruption of 14-3-3 binding induces accumulation of LRRK2 within cytoplasmic pools resembling inclusion bodiesA common role of 14-3-3 proteins is to influence the subcellular localization of the protein to which it binds. We therefore studied whether 14-3-3 binding might affect LRRK2 cellular localization. To ensure low-level expression and as uniform as possible, we generated Flp-in T-REx 293 cells that stably express the wild-type and non-14-3-3-binding Ser910/Ser935 mutant forms of full-length GFP–LRRK2. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the wild-type and mutant GFP–LRRK2 forms were expressed at similar levels (Figure 4A). We next studied the cellular localization using confocal microscopy and found that, consistent with a previous report [19], wild-type LRRK2 was uniformly distributed throughout the cytosol and excluded from the nucleus (Figure 4B). In contrast, the non-14-3-3-binding LRRK2(S910A), LRRK2(S935A) and LRRK2(S910A/S935A) mutants accumulated within cytosolic pools resembling inclusion bodies (Figure 4B).￼Characterization of 14-3-3 binding of 41 LRRK2 PD-associated mutantsWe next decided to investigate the Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and 14-3-3-binding properties of 41 PD forms of LRRK2. These mutations include the six most common pathogenic mutations that have been described to date (R1441C, R1441G, R1441H, Y1699C, G2019S and I2020T) [5,6]. Most of the other mutations studied have only been observed in low numbers of PD patients and further work is required to assess the contributions these mutations make to the development of disease [6]. The location of different mutations in LRRK2 analysed is indicated in the Figure 5 (inset). We expressed full-length wild-type and mutant forms of LRRK2 with an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag in HEK-293 cells. LRRK2 was immunoprecipitated and levels of protein were determined by quantitative immunoblotting analysis (Odyssey system). Similar levels of LRRK2 forms were subjected to immunoblot analysis, which revealed that most of the mutants were phosphorylated at Ser910 and Ser935 to a similar extent as the wild-type enzyme and interacted with 14-3-3 (Figure 5, lower panel). However, Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and hence 14-3-3 binding were abolished in four mutants (R1441G, Y1699C, E1874stop and I2020T) (Figure 5, lower panel). Phosphorylation of Ser910/Ser935 and 14-3-3 binding were significantly reduced in six other mutants (M712V, R1441H, R1441C, A1442P, L1795F and G2385R) (Figure 5, lower panel).￼We also compared the relative protein kinase specific activity of the 41 mutant forms of LRRK2 employing the LRRKtide peptide substrate [10] (Figure 5). Consistent with previous work [8–10], the LRRK2(G2019S) mutant possessed approx. 3-fold higher specific activity than wild-type LRRK2. Two other mutants, LRRK2(R1728H) and LRRK2(T2031S), also exhibited 2- and 4-fold increased activity respectively compared with wild-type LRRK2. Apart from the R1874stop mutation that lacks the kinase domain and is therefore inactive, all other mutants tested possessed similar activity to wild-type LRRK2.Association of 14-3-3 with endogenous LRRK2 is impaired in LRRK2(R1441C) knock-in miceTo obtain further evidence that the LRRK2(R1441C) PD mutation disrupts 14-3-3 binding, we compared levels of 14-3-3 associated with endogenous LRRK2 derived from previously reported littermate wild-type and homozygous LRRK2(R1441C) knock-in mice [20]. LRRK2 was immunoprecipitated from spleen, kidney and brain from three separate mice of each genotype. Immunoblotting and 14-3-3 overlay analysis demonstrated that level of LRRK2 expression was similar in the wild-type and knock-in mice, however, the level of Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and associated 14-3-3 was markedly reduced in tissues derived from LRRK2(R1441C) knock-in mice compared with wild-type (Figure 6). The largest effect of the knock-in mutation was observed in kidney.￼Cellular localization of 41 mutant forms of LRRK2To ensure low-level expression and as uniform as possible of the wild-type and mutant forms of full-length GFP–LRRK2, we generated the Flp-in T-REx 293 cells that stably express the wild-type and mutant forms of GFP–LRRK2. Immunoblot analysis revealed that GFP–LRRK2 forms were expressed at relatively similar levels (Figure 7). The localization of wild-type, kinase-dead and many other LRRK2 mutants studied were uniformly distributed throughout the cytosol and excluded from the nucleus with no accumulation within cytoplasmic pools observed (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure S1 to view larger images at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/430/bj4300393add.htm). Strikingly, most mutants that displayed reduced Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and binding to 14-3-3 accumulated within cytosolic pools resembling inclusion bodies (R1441C, R1441G, R1441H, A1442P, Y1699C, L1795F and I2020T). Not counting the truncated E1874stop mutant, which displays diffuse cytoplasmic localization, only two other mutants (M712V and G2385R) displaying reduced Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding (Figure 5), but did not accumulate in cytoplasmic pools (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure S1). It is possible that the ability of these mutants to still interact weakly with 14-3-3 isoforms may prevent their accumulation within cytoplasmic pools. Only a single mutant (R1067Q) was found to interact with 14-3-3 and accumulate within cytoplasmic pools (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure S1). The reasons for this require further work."
28582918	Generation of Human LRRK2 wild type and G2019S BAC miceThe F1 offspring from transgenic hWT and G2019S founders were characterized for LRRK2 expression and full length human LRRK2 cDNA transcript was found in one hWT and in four G2019S BAC lines. The data for G2019S mice presented in this manuscript are from the highest expressing G2019S line. The presence of the G→A base change was confirmed in human LRRK2 cDNA isolated from G2019S mice (Figure 1A). Regional localization of transgenic mRNA with a Taqman human specific probe (Figure 1B) and finer anatomical mapping via in situ hybridization with mouse and human specific LRRK2 probes revealed that anatomical expression pattern of the human LRRK2 transgene resembled endogenous mouse LRRK2, albeit with higher transgene expression in the hippocampus (Figure 1C). Lrrk2 protein expression was assessed using an in-house specific antibody PA0362 (Melrose et al., 2006) and confirmed protein expression in both hWT and G2019S transgenic lines in most brain regions (Figure 1D). To determine relative expression levels, extracts of half brain from NT, hWT and G2019S animals were immunoblotted with Lrrk2 antibody. Assuming the relative affinity of PA0362 to mouse and human Lrrk2 protein is comparable, in half-brain extracts the G2019S transgenic line was found to have ~2.5-fold protein expression over endogenous mouse Lrrk2 while the hWT line had ~ 3.5-fold protein expression (Supplemental Figure 1A,B). In all of the transgenic LRRK2 lines we generated, the human promoter drove the highest expression levels in the hippocampus. In hippocampal lysates human Lrrk2 protein levels were ~14 fold over murine levels for G2019S and ~20-fold for the hWT line (Supplemental Figure 1C,D).To determine if any compensatory mRNA changes were occurring, a mouse specific LRRK2 probe was used to measure endogenous murine LRRK2 expression in transgenic, versus non-transgenic mice. Murine LRRK2 expression remained consistent in all brain regions in G2019S and hWT transgenic brains compared to non-transgenic (NT) littermates (Figure 2). Similarly, no compensatory mRNA changes were observed in the LRRK2 paralog LRRK1, nor for SNCA and MAPT, two other genes implicated in PD (Figure 2).Dopaminergic system characterizationThe loss of striatal dopaminergic terminals and substantia nigra dopamine neurons is a prominent feature of both LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD. Stereological counts of TH positive neurons in the substantia nigra in aged hWT and G2019S mice (22–24 months) and age matched NT controls revealed no differences (neuronal estimates were NT = 8254 ± 732, hWT 8134 ± 262 and G2019S 8374 ± 317, Figure 3). Despite the apparent preservation of dopamine neurons in the transgenic mice, we hypothesized that axon terminal dopamine neurochemistry may still be altered. The concentration of dopamine and metabolites DOPAC and HVA was measured by HPLC in tissue punches from the striatum in hWT, G2019S and NT littermates mice aged 18 months. No significant differences were detected between transgenic and NT mice for dopamine nor its metabolites (Supplemental Figure 2), and correspondingly turnover ratios were comparable (data not shown).To further investigate the intact dopaminergic system in vivo, and in particular to measure extracellular dopamine levels, we performed microdialysis in hWT, G2019S BAC and age matched NT controls from each line. Extracellular dopamine levels were measured before and after amphetamine challenge. Amphetamine raises extracellular dopamine levels by inducing calcium-independent dopamine efflux via reverse transport through DAT and by inhibiting dopamine re-uptake (Schmitz et al., 2001). Remarkably we found that baseline dopamine levels were significantly lower (~66%) in hWT (mean ± SEM 2.95±0.23 p<0.0001) and in G2019S BAC mice (~33%, mean 4.96 ± 0.67 pg/μl, Mann Whitney p<0.002) compared to NT controls (7.36 ± 0.76 pg/μl) (Figure 4A). Conversely, the average dopamine levels following amphetamine challenge were comparable in the three groups (hWT 12.37±1.44, G2019S 12.13 ± 1.58 pg/ul and NT 10.31 ± 1.75 pg/μl, Figure 4A). When the post-amphetamine challenge levels for each animal were normalized to the average of their individual basal dopamine levels (i.e. % response) a significant difference was observed between the response in hWT (454 ± 119 % p<0.008) and G2019S BAC (397 ± 85 %, p<0.05) compared to NT controls (156 ± 21 %) after twenty minutes (Figure 4B). These data suggested that while basal dopamine levels were lower in hWT and G2019S mice, reverse transport of dopamine induced by amphetamine was intact. Likewise, this also confirmed that the deficits in extracellular dopamine levels were not due to reduced availability of dopamine stores.Given the lower basal levels of extracellular dopamine levels in the striatum in hWT and G2019S BAC mice compared to NT controls, we hypothesized that compensatory post-synaptic changes may occur over time in striatal dopamine receptors. We thus determined the density of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in striatum by quantitative autoradiography on tissue sections from 18 month old hWT, G2019S BAC and NT control mice. A modest 11% increase (P<0.01) was observed in D1 receptor density in hWT mice compared to NT controls (mean ± SEM for hWT 48.38 ± 0.85 and NT 42.98 ± 1.89, Figure 5A) however whilst there was a trend towards increased D1 receptors in the G2019S mice, it did not achieve significance (Figure 5B). Similarly, a trend towards increase D2 receptors existed for both hWT and G2019S mice compared to controls but this was not significant (Figure 5C and D). Quantitative DAT immunohistochemistry results suggested no differences in either hWT, nor in G2019S to NT controls (Fig 5E and F) although this does not rule out alterations in DAT activity or cellular localization of the receptor.One of the feedback mechanisms in nigro-striatal neurons is D2 autoreceptor mediated inhibition of synthesis and release. It is well known that antagonizing pre-synaptic D2 autoreceptors can remove this feedback inhibition, and cause increased synthesis as well as release of dopamine (Shi et al., 2000). In order to determine whether the observed extracellular dopamine differences in transgenic BAC mice was due to differential function of D2 receptors, hWT and G2019S BAC mice were treated with the D2 receptor antagonist raclopride, sacrificed 30 minutes later and dopamine and its metabolites measured. As expected, dopamine turnover, as measured by the ratio of dopamine metabolites to stores of dopamine (DOPAC/dopamine and HVA/dopamine) increased dramatically following treatment with raclopride (Supplemental Figure 3). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in levels of serine-40 phosphorylated TH after raclopride treatment, indicating increased synthesis (data not shown). However, there was no difference in this response between hWT or G2019S BAC transgenic and NT littermates suggesting that autoreceptor-mediated feedback is normal in these mice.Neuropathological AnalysisTo assess mice for neuropathological changes we examined LRRK2 transgenic mice aged up to 24 months using immunohistochemistry with neurodegenerative markers commonly observed in PD. No abnormalities in α-synuclein, phosphorylated pSer129 α-synuclein, nor in caspase-3 were observed (data not shown). In contrast, analysis with phospho-tau antibodies revealed that aged G2019S BAC (18–24 months) accumulate phosphorylated tau at epitopes pSer202 (CP-13) and pSer262/356 (12E8) (Figures 6and ​and7).7). The alterations in tau were not present in mice aged 6 or 12 months (data not shown). In aged G2019S mice, phospho-tau immunoreactivity was observed in the neuropil and in cell bodies in several regions throughout the brain, including cortical regions (Figure 6A,C), particularly the parietal association area, pre-limbic, medio-orbital, frontal association, cingulate and somatosensory cortices. In addition reactivity was also observed in hippocampus (Figure 6C), hypothalamus, amygdala and locus coeruleus. Moderate to heavy staining was also noted in white matter fibers in the thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum and midbrain, as well as tracts in the pontine base and medulla (Figure 7). In the hippocampal area phospho-tau pSer 262/356 positive staining was observed in non-neuronal cells that morphologically resembled oligodendroglia (Figure 6C). In general the immunostaining was more robust with the pSer 262/356 antibody compared to the pSer 202 antibody. Iba-1 staining for microglia revealed increased activation in the hippocampus of G2019S mice (Figure 6B), however in other regions of the brain, even those with tau alterations, microglial activation was not remarkable.To further determine the nature of the tau species, we performed western blot analysis with brain lysates from G2019S mice (18–24 months) and age matched NT mice with the pSer202 (CP-13) antibody and pSer396/404 (PHF-1), a phospho-epitope that is normally present in mice in white matter and gray matter (Hernandez et al., 2003). At pSer 202 epitope the most marked differences were observed in the cortex and the hippocampus, corresponding to the regions of highest transgenic expression (Figure 8A). However increased levels of pSer396/404 could be detected in most brain regions (Figure 9A). Following normalization to GAPDH, quantitative analysis for the pSer 202 antibody revealed that the upper ~60kDa band was around two-fold more abundant in G2019S compared to aged matched NT controls in both cortex and hippocampus, whereas the lower ~50kDa band was only slightly elevated. When the upper and lower bands were plotted as a ratio, in both cortex and hipocampus the ratio of the upper band to the lower band was at least 2.5 fold higher in G2019S compared to NTs (Figure 8B). Similarly, for the pSer396/404 epitope, the ratio of the middle ~55kDa to lower ~50 KDa bands, in the striatum, hippocampus, midbrain, cortex and cerebellum, was around 3 fold higher in G2019S compared to NTs (Figure 9B). To determine whether these alterations were due to differences in total tau, immunoblots were run with tau-5, which reacts with phosphorylated as well as non-phosphorylated forms of tau (Figure 9A). The banding pattern of total tau was visibly different between G2019S and NT controls, and in particular the two doublet bands around 50 and 55 kDa were altered in G2019S samples. Upon quantitative analysis it was apparent that the ratio of these two bands was altered in G2019S mice, such that in NT mice the ~50KDa species tended to be more prominent but in G2019S mice the ~55 kDA species tended to be equal or more abundant. When plotted as a ratio of middle/lower band, G2019S mice had at least two fold higher ratios than NT mice for striatum, hippocampus, cortex and midbrain (Figure 9B).We next asked whether the tau alterations were still apparent after dephosphorylation, hypothesizing that a shift in species composition might affect propensity for phosphorylation. Focusing just on the cortex, since it is a region of high Lrrk2 expression and pronounced tau changes, we compared untreated samples with samples dephosphorylated by enzymatic treatment with alkaline phosphatase. We utilized Tau-1, which has a preference for non-phosphorylated tau in axons before enzymatic treatment, but recognizes astrocytes, perineuronal glial cells, as well as axons, cell bodies and dendrites of neurons following enzymatic desphosphorylation (Papasozomenos 1987). The banding pattern for tau-1 in untreated samples (and thus predominantly axonal tau) was identical in NT and G2019S samples, suggesting that axonal tau levels and species composition were unaltered (Figure 10A). However, following dephosphorylation, the tau-1 banding pattern was different between NT and G2019S mice, with a more prominent ~65KDa band appearing in G2019S mice (Figure 10B,C) and a tendency for a shift in the relative intensity between the bands at ~60 and 62kDa (Figure 10D). These results suggest that non-axonal tau species composition is different in G2019S mice and furthermore, because the samples are dephosphorylated, the tau species changes cannot be due to phosphorylation, but instead must be another post-translational modification.Immunohistochemical analysis of hWT mice, despite their higher transgenic expression levels, revealed only modest increases pSer 262/356 (Figure 11), these changes being restricted to the hippocampal area where both cell bodies and processes were immunopositive. Western blotting with tau antibodies did not reveal any remarkable differences (data not shown).Behavioral AnalysisWe characterized hWT, G2019S and a combined age matched NT controls from each line in a battery of behavioral tests, which included motor abilities (beam-crossing test, inked footprint analysis), reactivity to sensory stimulation (negative geotaxis test) and evaluation of general exploratory activity (open-field test). In the beam test, hWT showed a comparable performance to age matched NT controls when crossing both wider and narrower beams (Supplemental Figure 4A). G2019S mice tended to reach the goal cage faster than NT controls, however this was not statistically significant. There was no difference in latency to move, nor in the number of falls from the beam for either hWT or G2019S mice when compared to NT controls (data not shown). In the geotaxis test all mice climbed up the inclined wire grid against the force of gravity indicating comparable motoric, postural and vestibular responses between the genotypes, which substantiated the absence of falling off the beam during the beam crossing test (Supplemental Figure 4B). Inked footprint analysis revealed similar stride-lengths between NT control mice and hWT and G2019S transgenic mice (Supplemental Figure 4 C,D).In the open field test, hWT and NT mice had comparable exploratory profiles, however G2019S mice showed significantly longer exploratory path (p <0.006) compared to NT mice (Figure 12A). Although overall activity levels were not altered (61.64% ± 6.29 NT and 66.72% ± 7.69 G2019S Figure 12B), the G2019S mice showed a trend (p = 0.056) towards greater thigmotaxis (mean ± SEM 55.73 cm ± 8.50 for NT and 80.17 ± 5.84 for G2019S, Figure 12C) searching the arena persistently in the close vicinity of the wall, as well as a tendency to taking less turns (tortuosity was 157.1 °/m ± 53.0 for NT versus 80.1 °/m ± 9.6 path for G9019S mice, Figure 12D) and spent less time exploring the central zone of the arena (4.49% ± 1.72 for NT versus 1.43%, ± 0.77 for G2019S, Figure 12E) including the novel object (2.07% ± 0.89 NT versus 0.93 ± 0.49 G2019S, Figure 12F). Post-hoc analysis revealed that the G9019S mice showed significantly faster walking speed (p < 0.05) in the arena (0.25 m/s ± 0.02 SEM) than NT mice (0.18 m/s ± 0.02 respectively). Taken together our data indicate that while performance for sensory and motor tasks appear equivalent in NT, hWT and G2019S mice, when placed in a novel environment, the G2019S mice exhibit reduced exploratory behaviors, which may be indicative of fear or anxiety."
28582919	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a very common neurodegenerative disorder with no proven neuroprotective or neurorestorative therapies. Recent advances in identifying genetic causes of PD have provided new opportunities for discovery of therapeutic targets and agents to potentially prevent the degenerative process of PD. Patients with LRRK2 mutations are clinically and neurochemically indistinguishable from idiopathic PD1. Disease segregating mutations in LRRK2 lead to neurotoxicity in vitro 2–4 and loss of dopamine neurons in PD patients 5. LRRK2 toxicity in vitro is linked to kinase activity and GTP binding, since mutations in LRRK2 that interfere with kinase activity and GTP binding, inhibit toxicity. Whether LRRK2 toxicity requires kinase activity in vivo and whether pharmacologic inhibition could protect against LRRK2 toxicity is not known.To identify LRRK2 inhibitors, LRRK2 autophosphorylation (Fig. 1) and LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Supplementary Fig. 1) were monitored in the presence or absence of 84 Biomol kinase and phosphatase inhibitors at 16 μM (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1). Indolinone compounds including staurosporine (compound 6), GF 109203X (compound 31), Ro 31- 8220 (compound 33), 5-iodotubercidin (compound 49), GW5074 (compound 56), and indirubin-3′-monooxime (compound 70) and anthracene compounds, SP 600125 (compound 68), damnacanthal (compound 22) substantially inhibit LRRK2 autophosphorylation (Fig. 1a, b) or LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of MBP (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). None of the inhibitors significantly enhanced LRRK2 kinase activity.The IC50’s of the 8 inhibitors were determined against autophosphorylation and MBP phosphorylation by wild type (WT) and G2019S LRRK2 (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Fig. 1 c, d and Supplementary Table 2). All the inhibitors except indirubin-3′-monooxime have relatively similar potency against WT and G2019S LRRK2 autophosphoryation activity (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Table 2). Indirubin-3′-monooxime more potently inhibits LRRK2 G2019S autophosphorylation. Staurosporine, damnacanthal, SP 600125, 5-iodotubercidin equivalently inhibit both WT and LRRK2 G2019S MBP phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 1 c, d and Supplementary Table 2). Both PKC inhibitors, Ro 31-8220 and GF109203X more potently inhibit both WT and G2019S LRRK2 MBP phosphorylation. GW5074 is less potent in inhibiting both WT and G2019S LRRK2 MBP phosphorylation. All 8 inhibitors have a similar inhibitory profile against LRRK1 autophosphorylation and MBP phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 2a d).Since LRRK2 and LRRK1 are related to the MAP kinase kinase kinase, Raf 6 and GW5074 inhibits Raf kinase 7, LRRK2 and LRRK1 autophosphorylation and MBP phosphorylation were monitored in the presence or absence of additional Raf kinase inhibitors, ZM336372, Sorafenib and Raf inhibitor IV (Fig. 1e). GW5074 more potently inhibits LRRK2 G2019S autophosphorylation and MBP phosphorylation than LRRK1 autophosphorylation and MBP phosphorylation (Fig. 1f, g and Supplementary Fig. 1e, f, 2e and Supplementary Table 3). ZM336372 has minimal to no effect on LRRK1 autophophorylation and MBP phosphorylation and no effect on WT or G2019S LRRK2 autophosphorylation or MBP phosphorylation. Both Sorafenib and Raf inhibitor IV inhibit LRRK2 autophosphorylation and MBP phosphorylation MBP with less potency than GW5074, but they have minimal to no effect on LRRK1 autophosphorylation or MBP phosphorylation (Fig. 1e, f, g and Supplementary Fig. 1e, f, 2e and Supplementary Table 3). These results taken together indicate that GW5074 inhibits both LRRK2 and LRRK1 kinase activities, whereas Sorafenib and Raf inhibitor IV are relatively selective for LRRK2 kinase activity and ZM336372 has minimal to no effect on both LRRK2 and LRRK1 kinase activities.Indirubin-3′-monooxime and the related analog, indirubin were also compared against LRRK1 WT, LRRK2 WT and LRRK2 G2019S autophosphorylation or MBP phosphorylation. Indirubin-3′-monooxime inhibits LRRK1 WT, LRRK2 WT and LRRK2 G2019S autophosphorylation and MBP phosphorylation, whereas indirubin has no effect on LRRK1 WT, LRRK2 WT and LRRK2 G2019S autophosphorylation or MBP phosphorylation (Supplementary Table 3). GW5074 and indirubin-3′-monooxime also inhibit LRRK2-mediated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein (4E-BP1), a putative physiologic LRRK2 substrate8, whereas ZM336372 and indirubin do not inhibit LRRK2 phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1h, i).Both LRRK2 WT and LRRK2 G2019S overexpression leads to primary cortical neuron injury as assessed by neurite shortening (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3) and LRRK2 G2019S overexpression leads to cell death as assessed by DNA fragmentation (TdT-mediated X-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay) (Supplementary Methods) (Fig. 2c, d), whereas a kinase dead versions of LRRK2 WT (D1994A) and LRRK2 G2019S (G2019S, D1994) are devoid of toxicity as previously described 3,4,9 (Fig. 2a, d and Supplementary Fig. 3). Treatment of the cortical cultures with 0.5 μM GW5074 and 0.5 μM indirubin-3′-monooxime, which inhibit both LRRK2 and LRRK1, attenuate LRRK2 G2019S cell injury and cell death (Fig. 2b, d). The Raf kinase inhibitor, Sorafenib (0.5 μM), which is relatively selective for LRRK2 (see Supplementary Table 3), also completely protects against LRRK2 G2019S toxicity (Fig. 2b, d and Supplementary Fig. 3). The Raf kinase inhibitor, ZM336372 (0.5 μM), which does not inhibit either LRRK2 or LRRK1 kinase activity fails to inhibit LRRK2 G2019S toxicity (Fig. 2b, d and Supplementary Fig. 3). The cyclin-dependent kinase and GSK-3β inhibitor, indirubin, which does not inhibit either LRRK2 or LRRK1 kinase activity fails to inhibit LRRK2 G2019S toxicity (Fig. 2b, d and Supplementary Fig. 3). These results taken together indicate that the protection afforded by the Raf inhibitors (GW5074 and Sorafenib) and the cyclin-dependent kinase and GSK-3β inhibitor, indirubin-3′-monooxime, are due to inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity and not inhibition of Raf, cyclin-dependent or GSK-3β kinase activity, respectively.To determine the efficacy of the LRRK2 kinase inhibitors in vivo, a herpes simplex virus (HSV) amplicon-based mouse model of LRRK2 DA neurotoxicity was developed (Supplementary Methods) (Fig. 2e, h). GFP is extensively co-expressed with TH and in ~75 % of substantia nigra compacta neurons after an intrastriatal HSVPrPUC/CMVeGFP injection (Supplementary Fig. 4). Immunoblot analysis confirms that WT, G2019S and G2019S, D1994A LRRK2 are overexpressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 2e). HSV amplicon-mediated delivery of LRRK2 G2019S induces significant loss of TH-positive neurons 3 weeks after stereotaxic injection into the ipsilateral striatum of mice compared to LRRK2 WT and eGFP control viruses (Fig. 2f, g). HSV amplicon-mediated delivery of LRRK2 G2019S, D1994A causes no neuronal loss similar to LRRK2 WT and GFP control viruses (Fig. 2f, g). Since GW5074 and indirubin-3′-monooxime and indirubin are known to cross the blood brain barrier 7,10,11, they were chosen to test whether inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity is protective in vivo. Twice daily injections of the LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, GW5074 and indirubin-3′-monooxime, (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuate the loss of TH-positive neurons induced by HSV-LRRK2 G2019S/CMVeGFP compared to DMSO and indirubin injected controls (Fig. 2f, h). The density of TH-positive fibers is also reduced in HSV-LRRK2 G2019S compared to HSV-eGFP control and HSV-LRRK2 WT and the reduction in the density of TH-positive fibers is rescued by GW5074 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Transduction of eGFP and LRRK2 WT do not show any signs of inflammation as determined by isolectin B4 (ILB4-positive cells), but LRRK2 G2019S induces a significant increase of ILB4-positive cells in the striatum and SNc, which is also prevented by administration of GW5074 (Supplementary Fig. 6).The major finding of this paper is the identification of kinase inhibitors that inhibit LRRK2 kinase activity and protect against LRRK2 toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Other kinase inhibitors have recently been reported to inhibit LRRK2 kinase activity with similar potency to those described here 12–15. Since an authentic substrate of LRRK2 has yet to be identified, there should be a note of caution regarding the physiological relevance of the screens used in this and related studies based on autophosphorylation and artificial substrates. These results hold particular promise for further studies focused on developing selective and potent inhibitors of LRRK2 kinase activity. Moreover, they demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity is a potentially promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of neurodegeneration in PD."
28582920	To explore whether we can recapitulate impaired neuritic outgrowth and branching in a LRRK2 over-expression model we prepared primary cultures from BAC LRRK2 transgenic animals and non-transgenic littermate controls. Human BAC LRRK2 transgenic animals express the transgene under the endogenous promoter, to mimic the temporal as well as regional expression patterns of the endogenous gene. Based on the expression pattern of full length hWT, GS and YC Lrrk2 proteins in various brain regions (Figure 1a) we decided to evaluate neuritic outgrowth in hippocampal cultures as the area of highest transgene expression. In the absence of reliable antibodies for immunocytochemistry, Western Blot analysis was applied to confirm Lrrk2 transgene expression in P2 primary cultures (Figure 1b). An initial time course experiment determined day 8 as optimal for harvesting (Suppl. Figure 2) as dendritic protein MAP2 expression was robust and uniform, serving as an ideal marker for neuritic process and branch quantification. In contrast, axonal marker proteins such as tau revealed morphological variability over the first days in culture and were difficult to quantify at later time points. To evaluate dendritic arborization, primary cultures of the various transgenic lines were analyzed for mean process length and the number of branches. Compared to non-transgenic littermate controls, primary neurons from both mutant lines (GS and YC) presented with significantly reduced neuritic outgrowth and branching (Figure 2a) while the number of processes per cell remained comparable (Suppl. Figure 3). We observed a similar outgrowth deficit in cells expressing YC or GS mutations, in contrast to previous reports based on viral transduction [11]. While over-expression of mutant Lrrk2 protein induced a significant deficit in neuritic outgrowth and branching, over-expression of Lrrk2 wild-type had no effect on these parameters (Figure 2b). Length, branching and the number of processes per cell were comparable between hippocampal neurons from hWT animals and littermate controls (NT) (Suppl. Figure 3).To test the hypothesis that enhanced Lrrk2 kinase activity is responsible for the deficits in neuronal process morphology, cells over-expressing mutant Lrrk2 proteins (GS and YC) were treated with 200pM staurosporine (see material and methods sections for more details). This indolocarbazole derivate was recently confirmed as a Lrrk2 kinase inhibitor in-vitro, although its actions are promiscuous and may affect many cellular kinases [13,14]. Partial rescue of the neuritic outgrowth deficit was equivalent in both GS and YC cultures. The same concentration had no effect on non-transgenic littermate controls (Figure 2c).A separate set of experiments was performed in LRRK2 KO models to investigate whether regulation of neuritic outgrowth and morphology is an inherent function of Lrrk2 (Suppl. Figure 1b,c). We have assessed homozygous KO, heterozygous KO and non-transgenic control littermates to evaluate the effect of zero, one and two endogenous Lrrk2 alleles. Hippocampal and midbrain primary cultures were included to compare results between regions of high (hippocampus) and low endogenous Lrrk2 expression (midbrain). TH-positive midbrain neurons were chosen because they are especially vulnerable to pathology and neuronal loss in PD.We observed a comparable increase in mean process length and branching in both hippocampal and midbrain primary neurons derived from animals completely lacking endogenous LRRK2 (homozygous KO) in contrast to non-transgenic controls. Heterozygous KO animals, retaining one copy of the LRRK2 gene, revealed no change in either neuritic outgrowth or branching (Figure 3a and b).As staurosporine is generally regarded as a relatively unspecific kinase inhibitor [14], we aimed to confirm that the partial rescue observed in BAC mutant LRRK2 cultures is due to Lrrk2 kinase inhibition. Hippocampal homozygous KO cultures were treated with 200pm staurosporine, as previously described. No significant difference in neuritic outgrowth was observed between treated and untreated cells (Figure 3c).While all previous studies exploring the impact of mutant Lrrk2 on neuritic outgrowth [9-11] have focused on over-expression models, it remains unknown whether a comparable phenotype is reproducible in a system where mutant Lrrk2 is expressed at physiological levels and with the correct regional distribution. To evaluate whether Lrrk2 mutations expressed at endogenous levels induce a deficit in neuritic outgrowth and branching, primary hippocampal and midbrain cultures from homozygous G2019S knock-in (KI) animals (expressing mutant Lrrk2 endogenously) and littermate controls were generated. Endogenous LRRK2 mRNA is expressed in rodent brain during development and adulthood, beginning as early as embryonic day 15.5 [15,16]. Evaluation of mean process length (Figure 4), branching and the number of processes (data not shown) in either hippocampal or TH-positive midbrain neurons revealed no significant changes. Hence, endogenous expression of mutant Lrrk2 protein does not compromise neuritic outgrowth."
28582921	To screen for Lrrk2 PPIs we applied the QUICK approach (22) using NIH3T3 cells, resulting in a list of putative Lrrk2 complex components. A schematic overview of the experimental workflow followed in our study is presented in Fig. 1: a subset of the identified proteins was verified for its interaction with Lrrk2 by Western blot analysis following co-IP. Database-curated interaction data and interactions indicated by the experimental results were used to generate an Lrrk2 PPI network on the basis of the identified Lrrk2 complex partners. The result links Lrrk2 function to the actin-based cytoskeleton. Physiological relevance of the hypothesis was verified by both F-actin cosedimentation assays, determining the ability of Lrrk2 to bind F-actin and to modulate its assembly in vitro, and cellular assays, analyzing the morphology of NIH3T3 cells and DA neurons within primary VM cultures upon lentiviral-mediated knockdown of Lrrk2.Lrrk2 Interacts with Components of the Actin CytoskeletonTo identify Lrrk2 interacting proteins we conducted the QUICK approach (22), which combines SILAC, RNAi-induced knockdown, co-IP and quantitative MS to screen for endogenous PPIs.A prerequisite for the QUICK assay is the efficient depletion of the protein of interest within an appropriate cell type. We showed in a previous study that the expression of the Lrrk2-specific second generation shRNAmir construct miB3 in NIH3T3 cells results in an efficient Lrrk2 protein decline without induction of an immune response (24). Thus, corresponding viral supernatants were obtained and NIH3T3 cells were transduced with LVmiB3 1 day after plating. For the metabolic labeling with SILAC, wt and LVmiB3-transduced NIH3T3 cells were grown in “heavy” or “light medium” for at least five passages. Lrrk2 knockdown efficiency was monitored by Western blot analysis using the Lrrk2-specific antibody clone 1E11 (data not shown). To test whether the knockdown of Lrrk2 itself would lead to global changes in the proteome of NIH3T3 cells, whole cell lysates were prefractionated by SDS-PAGE, proteins were subjected to tryptic in-gel cleavage and the resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Supplemental Table 1). SlLAC quantification did not reveal considerable alterations in the proteome after shRNA expression. Applying the QUICK approach, proteins were immunoprecipitated using a rat-monoclonal anti-Lrrk2 antibody and peptides from the pooled eluates were subjected to LC-MS/MS. Lrrk2 was significantly enriched 3.57-fold in the wt compared with the knockdown condition (p ≤ 0.05, Table I). In addition, we identified 36 proteins with significantly increased abundance ratios (p ≤ 0.05, Table I), which we considered as potential Lrrk2 interaction partners. Moreover, we found 355 proteins being equally abundant in both conditions and therefore considered to be nonspecific contaminants (Supplemental Table 2). By literature-based curation, the potential interactors were categorized according to their molecular function, with the majority of the identified proteins clustered into four groups and merely six of them possessing miscellaneous functions (group 5). Group 1 represents proteins belonging to the actin family, the second group includes actin-regulatory proteins that steer the formation of actin filaments and their organization in structural higher-order networks. Additionally, we identified proteins belonging to the myosin superfamily (group 3) and modulators of these actin-dependent motor proteins that are listed in group 4. Moreover, a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Pathway Palette to obtain an unbiased indication of overrepresented cellular process categories in the set of Lrrk2 complex components. The analysis yielded the highest enrichment for proteins annotated to the “regulation of actin cytoskeleton” pathway (KEGG pathway entry #hsa04810), with the by far strongest significance of p < 10−10.35 (Supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, the proteins could be mapped to several other, not necessarily independent pathways whose significance did however not exceed 10−3.6 (“leukocyte transendothelial migration”).A selection of the identified Lrrk2 protein complex components was confirmed to interact with Lrrk2 by independent co-IP followed by Western blotting (Fig. 2), utilizing cell extracts from wt and LVmiB3-transduced NIH3T3 cells. The analysis with anti-myosin Id, anti-Arp3 and anti-tropomyosin revealed specific signals for wt cells compared with those of shRNA expressing NIH3T3, displaying no or weak bands, and thus confirming the results of the QUICK assay.Interactions between the identified Lrrk2 complex partners were parsed and visualized using Pathway Palette in an evaluated and prioritized manner, applying interaction data stored in the HPRD and BioGRID database. Within the group of 37 specific interactors (nodes), the analysis identified 36 previously reported interactions (edges) between 20 individual nodes (Fig. 3A). To evaluate the physical cohesiveness of the inferred interaction network we applied PIE analysis. Fig. 3B shows the frequency distribution of edge numbers within the simulated protein sets (n = 1,000,000 simulated networks, set size 37). The analysis yielded a PIE score of 1.78 and a p value < 10−6 and thus reveals significant physical cohesiveness for the proteins identified within the QUICK assay, meaning that they interact with one another at a significantly higher frequency than a random set of proteins with the same node degree distribution. According to database searches for PPIs, interactions of proteins with Lrrk2 could not be automatically covered in the network. However, on the basis of the experimental results within both the QUICK assay and co-IP experiments, these associations were manually added, resulting in a Lrrk2 interaction network (Fig. 3A) that illustrates the close relationship between the identified proteins. To further analyze the connectivity between the Lrrk2 complex components, the network was expanded by linking pairs of proteins through interconnecting proteins using interaction data from the HPRD and BioGRID database, enabling the mapping of 10 additional proteins from the QUICK set into the network (Supplemental Fig. 2). Fidelity of the network was assessed through manual evaluation of all extensions in a literature-based fashion, with functional information extracted from peer-reviewed publications (Supplemental Table 3). The analysis revealed that the interconnecting neighbors predominantly comprise proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton and/or affecting its modulation as well as myosins and their regulators. Thus, the extended network strengthens an inherent correlation among the identified Lrrk2 interacting proteins.Lrrk2 Binds F-actin and Affects its Polymerization In VitroThe finding that Lrrk2 interacted with actin isoforms and other cytoskeletal proteins suggested a possible association between Lrrk2 and F-actin. Therefore, we assessed F-actin binding of Lrrk2 in vitro in a cosedimentation assay using recombinant SF-TAP tagged Lrrk2 purified from HEK293 cells. After incubating a constant amount of actin (3 μm) with different concentrations of Lrrk2 (150 nm and 300 nm) under constant buffer conditions, actin was sedimented by centrifugation at steady-state level of polymerization. The pellets and supernatants, containing polymerized and unpolymerized actin, respectively, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining (Fig. 4A, upper panel). (Co)sedimentation of Lrrk2 was visualized by Western blotting using an anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 4A, lower panel). Based hereupon, the amount of both Lrrk2 and actin present in the supernatants or pellets was quantified (Fig. 4B and C). In the absence of actin, Lrrk2 was only present in the supernatant, indicating that Lrrk2 did not self-aggregate forming pellets (Fig. 4A, condition 5). Coomassie brilliant blue staining following SDS-PAGE of the purified protein revealed the purity of the affinity preparation (Fig. 4A, upper panel, condition 5) as demonstrated in a previous study (36). In the presence of actin, Lrrk2 localized to the pellet fractions, visualized by Western blotting (Fig. 4A, lower panel, conditions 3 and 4; Fig. 4B). With increasing concentrations of Lrrk2 incubated with actin, we observed a concentration-dependent enhanced recovery of Lrrk2 with F-actin in the pellet fraction (Fig. 4B). Depending on the protein batch, the amount of Lrrk2 in the pellet increased between 1.3- and 2.3-fold using an added concentration of 300 nm versus 150 nm Lrrk2. Lrrk2 led furthermore to a significant increase in actin present in the supernatants, as shown by the quantification of Coomassie stained gels (Fig. 4A and C). Whereas in the control samples the majority of actin sedimented (Fig. 4A, upper panel, conditions 1 and 2; Fig. 4C), the addition of substoichiometric amounts of Lrrk2 decreased the amount of polymerized actin (Fig. 4A, upper panel, conditions 3 and 4; Fig. 4C). As demonstrated in Fig. 4C, the shift in the G-/F-actin ratio toward the monomeric form (in the supernatant) is statistically significant in the presence of increasing Lrrk2 (p < 0.01 and 0.001 versus SB buffer control, n= 4, one-way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak post-hoc test). At a concentration of 300 nm, Lrrk2 induced a ~1:1 distribution of actin between supernatant (48.00 ± 2.54%) and pellet (52.00 ± 2.54%) (Fig. 4C).Overall, our results demonstrate an association of Lrrk2 to F-actin. Moreover, under the in vitro conditions used, the G-actin/F-actin balance at equilibrium is altered in favor of G-actin indicating that Lrrk2 affects actin polymerization.Effect of Lentiviral-Mediated Knockdown of Lrrk2 on NIH3T3 MorphologyThe actin cytoskeleton plays a fundamental role in eukaryotic cells and is a major determinant of cell morphology. The assembly and disassembly of filamentous actin structures provide a driving force for dynamic processes within the cell. Fibroblasts are commonly used to study the mechanisms of actin cytoskeleton reorganization (40, 41). Therefore, we used NIH3T3 cells to investigate whether Lrrk2 depletion affects the cellular morphology. Wt, LVTH- and LVmiB3-transduced NIH3T3 cells were plated on glass coverslips and serum-starved for 24 h. Upon silencing of Lrrk2 the cells displayed a change in morphology in terms of elongation and narrowing of the cell body, whereas the wt and LVTH-transduced controls had a typical fibroblast-like morphology (Fig. 5A). As a quantitative measure of cell shape, we determined the ratio of perimeter to area (P:A-ratio) (38) and calculated both the average P:A-ratio (Fig. 5B) and its frequency distribution (Fig. 5C) for the different conditions. Frequency distribution analysis confirmed the immunocytochemical observations. The P:A-ratio in all three conditions ranged from 0.05 μm−1 to greater than 0.40 μm−1 with the majority of cells falling in the range between 0.20 μm−1 and 0.35 μm−1 (Fig. 5C). However, the distribution of the P:A-ratio revealed a shift toward higher values in the Lrrk2 knockdown cultures (Fig. 5C), indicating that a significant proportion of the cells showed cell body elongation and narrowing. The proportions of cells in the ranges of 0.15–0.2 μm−1 and 0.2–0.25 μm−1 were significantly reduced in the shRNA-treated cultures (p < 0.001 versus wt, n = 4, two-way-ANOVA, Bonferroni post-hoc test; wt: 12.06 ± 1.0% and 27.07 ± 1.0%; LVTH: 12.00 ± 1.3% and 27.59 ± 0.9%; LVmiB3: 8.53 ± 0.8% and 23.28 ± 1.0%), whereas the percentage of cells with a ratio greater than 0.4 μm−1 was significantly increased (p < 0.001 versus wt, n = 4, two-way ANOVA; wt: 10.07 ± 0.7%, LVTH: 10.68 ± 1.1% and LVmiB3: 16.07 ± 1.5%). This resulted in an increase in the average P:A-ratio of NIH3T3 cells expressing the miB3 silencing construct from 0.286 ± 0.004 μm−1 and 0.286 ± 0.005 μm−1 for wt and LVTH-control cells, respectively, to 0.309 ± 0.005 μm−1 for LVmiB3 cells (p < 0.01 versus wt, n = 4, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc test) (Fig. 5B). These results denote that NIH3T3 cells undergo marked alterations in cell morphology upon Lrrk2 knockdown.Lentiviral-Mediated Knockdown of Lrrk2 in Primary VM Cultures Results in a Significant Decrease in Dopaminergic Neurite LengthOn the basis of the pathological association between Lrrk2 and PD and the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in neuronal morphogenesis (42), we investigated the role of endogenous Lrrk2 in neuronal cells. Therefore, we applied the lentiviral-mediated knockdown of Lrrk2 by shRNA expression to primary VM cultures. In addition to miB3 we designed a second, independent shRNAmir construct on the basis of the naturally expressed microRNA-30 precursor, miB4.Primary VM cultures derived from E12.5 mouse embryos were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding the Lrrk2 targeting shRNAs (LVmiB3 and LVmiB4) or the empty vector (LVTH) 1 day after plating and were analyzed at DIV9 or DIV14. Transduction of the VM cultures with LVmiB3 and LVmiB4 resulted in a significant decrease of Lrrk2 mRNA levels relative to wt cultures (p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 6A) and led to a relative Lrrk2-expression ratio of 0.50 ± 0.03 (LVmiB3, n = 5) and 0.52 ± 0.03 (LVmiB4, n= 3) at DIV9 and 0.45 ± 0.04 (LVmiB3, n = 5) and 0.51 ± 0.01 (LVmiB4, n = 4) at DIV14 (Fig. 6A). The decline in Lrrk2 mRNA levels after expression of the two silencing constructs was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in Lrrk2 protein content (Fig. 6B). We showed in a previous study that the expression of miB3 in cortical cultures does not activate a shRNA-mediated interferon response (24). Likewise, we observed no meaningful induction of Oas1 expression in LVmiB3- and LVmiB4-transduced primary VM cultures (data not shown) hence excluding an immune response, providing accordance with published RNAi guidelines (43, 44).For the phenotypic analysis of shRNA expressing primary VM cultures, cells were fixed, dopaminergic neurons were visualized by TH-immunohistochemistry and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The transduction with lentiviral vectors encoding Lrrk2 targeting shRNAs or the empty vector alone resulted in a transduction efficiency of TH-ir neurons of about 90%, determined at both DIV9 and DIV14 (data not shown). First, we quantified the amount of TH-ir cells relative to nontransduced wt cultures. At DIV9 no significant alterations in the relative number of TH-ir neurons was observed (p > 0.05 versus wt, n = 4–5, one-way ANOVA; wt: 99.28 ± 1.20%, LVTH: 102.12 ± 3.64%; LVmiB3: 102.16 ± 3.22% and LVmiB4: 97.34 ± 8.37%) (Fig. 7A). As recently as at DIV14, transduction of the cultures with either LVmiB3 or LVmiB4 caused a significant decrease in relative cell counts to 78.38 ± 4.18% and 74.92 ± 5.40%, respectively (p < 0.01 versus wt, n = 3–5, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 7A). The relative amount of TH-ir neurons in the LVTH control expressing cultures revealed a reduction to 89.46 ± 5.79%, which was not statistically significant (p > 0.05 versus wt, n = 4, one-way ANOVA).Similar to NIH3T3 cells, we analyzed whether the depletion of Lrrk2 had an effect on the morphology of DA neurons. Fig. 8 shows representative images and camera lucida drawings of untreated wt, LVTH control and Lrrk2 knockdown (LVmiB3 and LVmiB4) cultures at DIV9 and DIV14. Knockdown of Lrrk2 led to shortened neurites as early as at DIV9 (Fig. 8A and B), which was even more pronounced at DIV14 (Fig. 8C and D). Quantitative measurements of the neurite length at DIV9 confirmed the immunocytochemical observations and revealed that the transduction with LVmiB3 led to a significant shift in the neurite length distribution (p < 0.001 versus wt, χ2) to shorter neurites (Fig. 7C). Expression of the LVmiB4 construct led also to a shift toward lower value, although it was not significant (p > 0.05 versus wt, χ2). However, the population of neurites with a length of 40 μm or shorter increased significantly compared with wt cultures (p < 0.001, n = 4–5, two-way ANOVA; wt: 24.04 ± 0.71%, LVmiB4: 33.29 ± 1.01%). Furthermore, the relative amount of processes with a length between 40–80 μm and 80–120 μm decreased from 22.68 ± 0.91% and 22.39 ± 0.81% (wt) to 19.51 ± 1.24% and 19.55 ± 0.89% (LVmiB4) (p < 0.05 versus wt, n = 4–5, two-way ANOVA). The alterations in neurite length distributions were reflected in a significant decrease in the average length of neurite extensions of TH-ir neurons expressing shRNAs targeting Lrrk2 over wt controls (p < 0.001 versus wt, n = 4–5, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 7B). The outgrowth declined from 90.60 ± 0.98 μm in wt cultures to 58.92 ± 0.58 μm in LVmiB3-transduced and 82.20 ± 1.89 μm in LVmiB4-transduced cultures. In the LVTH control no alterations in the frequency distribution and average neurite length (91.54 ± 1.34 μm) were observed. Neurons cultivated until DIV14 possessed on average significantly longer processes than at DIV9 (p < 0.001 DIV9 versus DIV14, n = 3–5, two-way ANOVA), regardless of whether they expressed shRNA constructs or not (Fig. 7B). However, the average neurite length of LVmiB3- or LVmiB4-transduced TH-ir neurons at DIV14 was still significantly decreased compared with the wt or LVTH condition (p < 0.001 versus wt, n = 3–5, one-way ANOVA; wt: 122.03 ± 1.71 μm, LVTH: 120.45 ± 2.81 μm, LVmiB3: 69.73 ± 1.03 μm, LVmiB4: 103.65 ± 2.35 μm) (Fig. 7B). The corresponding neurite length distributions displayed a shifting to lower values, which was significant for both Lrrk2 targeting shRNA constructs (p < 0.001 LVmiB3 versus wt, p < 0.01 LVmiB4 versus wt, χ2) (Fig. 7C). Thus, depletion of Lrrk2 in primary VM cultures resulted in an impaired outgrowth of developing DA neurites."
28582922	Human G2019S Lrrk2 is highly expressed in regions of adult neurogenesisRegional expression of transgenic LRRK2 mRNA was assessed with a human-specific Taqman probe and revealed that the highest transgene expression in adult G2019S mice occurred in the hippocampal formation (Fig. 1A). Finer anatomical mapping using in situ hybridization with a LRRK2 human-specific probe confirmed that high expression was found in the Cornu Ammonis fields and, importantly, in the DG (Fig. 1B). Consistent with mRNA results, immunoblotting with a Lrrk2 specific antibody, PA0362, revealed that Lrrk2 protein levels were robust in the hippocampus (Fig 1C), in agreement with the estimated 14-fold expression over endogenous levels previously reported for the hippocampus in this line (Melrose et al 2010). Expression of murine Lrrk2 in the SVZ was described in detail previously (Melrose et al 2007). While we are unable to determine the exact level of human transgenic over-expression in the SVZ by Western blotting, expression analysis in hemi-brains from transgenic mice previously revealed an overall 3-fold expression of transgenic Lrrk2 protein versus endogenous Lrrk2 (Melrose et al 2010). Immunofluorescence with the Lrrk2 antibody revealed robust Lrrk2 expression in chains of neuroblasts in both NT and G2019S mice (Fig. 2J–M).Proliferation is markedly reduced in G2019S transgenic miceAs Lrrk2 is highly expressed in the adult DG and SVZ, we sought to ascertain whether this expression has an impact on cell proliferation. We analyzed the effect of Lrrk2 G2019S overexpression on newly generated cells in the hippocampal DG and SVZ 24 hours after a single injection of BrdU (Fig. 2A). We compared proliferation in G2019S versus NT littermate controls. Unbiased stereological counting methods were applied to estimate the number of BrdU-labeled cells. A significant decrease in BrdU-positive cells was detected in G2019S mice compared to NTs, as evidenced by a ~54% (p<0.01) decrease in proliferation in the DG (Fig. 2B, C) and in the SVZ (~36% decrease, p<0.05, Fig. 2D–F). The rostral migratory stream (RMS) appeared thinner in the Lrrk2 G2019S mice, with less BrdU-positive cells within this structure (Fig. 2G–I).Survival of new neurons in the olfactory bulb is significantly decreased in G2019S transgenic miceTo investigate the survival of newly generated neurons, four-month-old G2019S mice and NT littermates received daily intraperitoneal injections of BrdU for five consecutive days and were sacrificed 30 days later (Fig. 3A). A significant decrease in numbers of newly generated neurons was present in the granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb (41% decrease compared to NT, p<0.0001, Fig. 3B–E) and the glomerular layer (73% decrease, p<0.0001, Fig. 3B, F–I). The ratio of neuronal (NeuN-positive) profiles among the BrdU-positive cells was not significantly altered; neurons represented the majority of newly generated cells, with 94% (NT) and 96% (G2019S) in the olfactory bulb granule cell layer and 81% (NT) and 74% (G2019S) in the glomerular layer. Moreover, the TH-positive neurons were significantly decreased in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, where a 72% decrease of TH-positive cells was detected (Fig. 3J–M, p<0.0001). The ratio of dopaminergic differentiation was not significantly different between both groups [18% (NT) and 17% (G2019S) of all BrdU-positive cells].Survival of new neurons in the DG is significantly decreased in G2019S transgenic miceThe number of BrdU-positive cells was reduced significantly in the DG of G2019S mice (73% decrease, p=0.0002) compared to the NT group (Fig. 4B). Adult neurogenesis was further studied by determining the fate of BrdU-labeled cells. The total number of newly generated neurons (BrdU/NeuN) was significantly reduced in the G2019S group (77% decrease, p<0.001, Fig. 4C, D). The percentages of neuronal differentiation of BrdU-positive cells did not differ significantly between NT (69%) and G2019S mice (64%). DG volumes were unchanged between transgenics and controls (0.1 mm3 in both groups).Dendrite length and branching points in new neurons are reduced in G2019S miceTo further analyze the dendritic morphology of newly generated neurons in G2019S mice compared to NT controls, we delivered concentrated GFP retrovirus (1×8 transduction units/ml) into the DG of three-month-old G2019S transgenic and NT mice. Brains were harvested one month after the retroviral injection (Fig. 5A). At this time point, the dendrites of newborn granule cells in control animals showed a highly polarized morphology. Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer allows the study of the morphological details of neurite outgrowth in new neurons (Zhao et al 2006). They had an elaborate dendritic arbor with abundant spines extending into the molecular layer (Fig. 5B), and the axons had reached their target area, CA3 (van Praag et al 2002; Zhao et al 2006). However, in the G2019S mice, less dendritic arborization and shorter dendrite lengths were observed (Fig. 5B). We measured dendrite length and branching points and found a 60% decrease in dendrite length in the G2019S group (Fig. 5C, p<0.0001). In addition, the arborization was severely impaired in these animals, with a decrease of 66% in branching points (p<0.0001, Fig. 5D).Spine density and mushroom spines are decreased in G2019S miceMature granule neurons receive most of their synaptic inputs from the entorhinal cortex through dendritic spines. Therefore, the number and shape of the dendritic spines are indicative of the connectivity of these newly generated cells. We asked whether spine density and development were also affected in the G2019S transgenic mice. The time point analyzed reflects a stage of late spine development (Fig. 6a; van Praag et al 2002). A significant difference was found in the G2019S group, with a 64% decrease in spine density (p<0.001, Fig. 6B, C). Spines have been categorized into different types on the basis of their morphology, which also reflects their maturation stage: mushroom, thin, stubby, and filopodia. Mushroom spines are more abundant in mature neurons, whereas thin, stubby and filopodia are immature developing stages (Nimchinsky et al 2002, Sala 2002). Interestingly, the number of mushroom spines was decreased in G2019S mice, indicating that, at this time point, mature, developed spines are less frequent in G2019S mice (decrease of 53%, p<0.001, Fig. 6D).Running increases the generation of new neurons in Lrrk2 G2019S miceThe rate of neurogenesis in the mammalian brain is not constant but can be influenced by numerous factors, among them enhancement by voluntary physical activity (van Praag et al 1999b). Enhanced physical activity subsequent to the introduction of a running wheel doubles proliferation in the DG as compared to what is observed in mice housed in standard conditions (van Praag et al 1999b). Moreover, voluntary physical activity increases the relative survival of the newly generated cells as well as the percentage of neuronal differentiation (van Praag et al 1999a). DCX is a marker used to assess and quantify changes occurring in the rate of neurogenesis in the DG following enhanced physical activity (Couillard-Despres et al 2005). When comparing non-running NT and G2019S mice (Fig. 7A), the decrease in neurogenesis reported above for BrdU/NeuN cell numbers was also reflected in a decrease in numbers of DCX-expressing neuroblasts (decrease of 71% in G2019S, p<0.001, Fig. 7B, C). Compared to NT non-running mice, NT running mice showed a significant increase in numbers of DCX-positive cells as a result of the increased physical activity (34% increase, p<0.05). This effect is confirmed between different strains of mice (Kempermann et al 2006; van Praag et al 1999b). Interestingly, there is also a significant increase in numbers of DCX-positive cells in the running G2019S group, indicating that the decreased numbers of DCX-labeled cells in the DG of non-running Lrrk2 G2019S animals could be partially reversed by physical activity (nearly 3-fold increase compared to Lrrk2 G2019S non-running group) and not statistically different from NT non-runners. This finding suggests that increased physical activity is capable of partially reversing the decrease in neurogenesis induced by Lrrk2 G2019S overexpression."
28582926	LRRK2 KO and G2019S models have opposite transcriptional responsesUsing Affymetrix microarrays, we assessed the genome-wide expression profiles in the striatum, cortex, kidney and muscle of the LRRK2 KO and G2019S animals. LRRK2 KOs had more pronounced transcriptional changes across all tissues than G2019S when compared with wild-type (WT) littermate controls. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) within each tissue identified 647, 587, 485 and 447 sequences differentially expressed (P < 0.01) for the cortex, kidney, muscle and striatum, respectively, of KO animals relative to WT controls (Fig. 2A). The kidney, which expresses high levels of LRRK2, and muscle, which is a potential clinically accessible tissue, were included in the analysis. Estimated false positive rates (FDRs) for these signatures were 30, 48, 72 and 82%, respectively. Animals overexpressing LRRK2 had smaller but significant differences in brain regions only (striatum and cortex) when compared with their non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 2B). One-way ANOVA within each tissue identified 557 and 390 sequences differentially expressed (P < 0.01) for the striatum and cortex, respectively, of G2019S animals relative to NTg controls. Estimated FDR for these signatures was above 50% for both.We hypothesized that if LRRK2 KO and G2019S had opposite effects on gene expression, we would observe larger and more significant transcriptional differences by directly comparing KO and G2019S animals than by comparison with the respective controls. To test this hypothesis, gene expression levels in KO and G2019S animals were first normalized to expression levels in their respective NTg littermate controls to remove any potential mouse strain differences. Then, gene expression levels in KO and G2019S animals were directly compared using ANOVA to reveal robust signatures in each tissue examined (Fig. 3). This analysis identified 2986 (FDR 11.7%), 2045 (FDR 17.5%), 1646 (FDR 22%) and 761 (FDR 48%) sequences differentially expressed (P < 0.01) in the cortex, striatum, kidney and muscle between LRRK2 KO and G2019S animals (Fig. 3A).In order to identify transcripts regulated similarly by genotype across tissue types, we performed two-way ANOVA using all samples controlling for tissue type and genotype. This analysis identified 1833 sequences differentially expressed (P < 0.001, FDR 1.9%) between LRRK2 KO and G2019S, which we refer to as the LRRK2 genotype signature, and these changes were generally observed in all four tissues (Fig. 3B). Moreover, we found 11 highly significant transcripts by two-way ANOVA (with factors being tissue type and genotype, P < 0.001) that were detected across all four tissues tested. Gh (growth hormone), Prl (prolactin) and Lrrk2 exhibited the highest average expression across all tissues in G2019S relative to KO animals (Table 1).Conversely, hypothetical (microbodies C-terminal targeting signal/phenylalanine-rich region containing protein), zinc finger protein 287 (Znf287), RIKEN cDNA 4930572J05 and neuronal growth regulator 1 (Ngr1, particularly in the striatum) genes exhibited the lowest average expression across all tissues in G2019S relative to KO animals.To identify what tissue(s) had the biggest changes in mRNA expression, we ran correlation analyses between cross-tissue (combined expression) and each of the tissue LRRK2 G2019S and LRRK2 KO sets. Out of four tissues studied, we found that the cortex and striatum mRNA expressions contributed most to detected changes by the Pearson correlation (r2 = 0.98 and 0.95, respectively).Validation of the transcriptional responses in LRRK2 KO and G2019S modelsTo validate these findings, we used TaqMan to assay 80 named genes that met the following criteria in the striatum: (i) more than 60% expression difference between LRRK2 G2019S and KO; (ii) more than 20% expression difference between the corresponding model (LRRK2 KO or G2019S) and control (WT or non-transgenic litter mates, NTg); (iii) dynamics of expression was opposite (up-down and down-up) in LRRK2 G2019S and LRRK2 KO (Fig. 4). It should be noted that LRRK2 did not meet this criteria, as the array probes do not detect the G2019S transgene.In the striatum, 22 of the genes were confirmed to be significantly (P < 0.05) different between LRRK2 G2019S versus KO by TaqMan with direction in agreement with the array data (Fig. 4). Forty-four of the other 58 assayed genes exhibited trends in differential expression between GS and KO consistent with the array data. Importantly, for all 22 significant genes, LRRK2 KO and LRRK2 G2019S had significant or trending opposite effects on expression relative to their respective WT controls. Nine of the 22 genes were confirmed to be increased in LRRK2 G2019S versus KO. Genes that were increased >10-fold in 2019S relative to KO include S100a8, S100a9, Gabra6, Pcp2 and Crtam, 5–10-fold are Cbln3 and Cdkn1a and <5-fold are Abcb11 and Spef2. Six of the nine increased transcripts (S100a8, S100a9, Gabra6, Crtam, Cbln3 and Cdkn1a) were also significantly different when compared with non-transgenic littermate controls (Fig. 4A). Thirteen of 22 transcripts were decreased in the striatum of LRRK2 G2019S versus KO mice. Four of these were increased within the 5–10-fold range (Cdh1, Prg4, Slc22a6  and Prdm6), while five were significant against non-transgenic controls. Cdkn1a (increased in G2019S) and Slc22a6(decreased in G2019S) were confirmed to be significant against both the matching genotype controls and after direct LRRK2 G2019S versus KO comparison in the striatum.We also assessed the expression of these genes in the cortex by TaqMan. Although this gene set was not selected based on microarray evidence for changes in the cortex, nine genes showed expression changes in the overall same direction as the striatum. Those genes that showed obvious similar direction of changes in both the striatum and cortex included S100a8, S100a9, Abcb1, Cdkn1a, Pcp2 and Mid1 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, five genes in the cortex changed in a direction opposite to the striatum (Tnfrsf11b, 4Cytl1, Fmod, Prdm6  and Prg4). S100a8, S100a9  and Slc22a6 were found to be significantly altered in the cortex, when compared with NTg controls (LRRK2 G2019S), and Cdkn1a, when compared with WT (P < 0.05, LRRK2 KO).To help prioritize these genes for follow-up, we used IPA and DAVID to assess whether the human homologs were targets of existing drugs or biomarkers. Only Gabra6 was found to be targeted by existing drugs according to the Ingenuity database, and six of the 22 genes have been proposed as diagnostic/efficacy biomarkers according to IPA. For detailed annotations of the 22 genes, see Table 2.LRRK2 regulates ribosomal function and glycolysis pathwaysTo identify the biological pathways that may underlie the transcriptional responses to the loss or the gain of LRRK2 function, we ran gene set enrichment analyses using multiple public ontological databases (see Methods for details). It was strikingly evident that animals overexpressing LRRK2 had an overall up-regulation, while LRRK2 KOs an overall down-regulation in genes involved in the ribosomal function. The kidney (E-value 0.003), cortex (E-value 0.001) and striatum (E-value 0.026) showed highly significant enrichment for genes involved in ribosomal function/translation function when analyses were run using gene signatures (P < 0.01) from each tissue separately or from the cross-tissue genotype signature (P < 0.001; E-value 4.8E–10; Table 3).Interestingly, another highly significant pathway expressed higher in the striatum of G2019S versus KO was glycolysis (E-value 0.009, Table 3). Only two other pathways were borderline significant in this comparison, and both of these were enriched in the muscle signature: clathrin-mediated endocytosis (E-value 0.1; 11 overlapping genes) and cell adhesion_alpha 4 integrin (E-value 0.26; 6 overlapping genes), identified by Ingenuity and GeneGo, respectively (not shown).We selected 13 ribosomal genes identified by gene set enrichment analysis that were significantly modulated in the cross-tissue genotype signature (P < 0.001) for TaqMan validation based on the assay availability. The results of expression of these 13 ribosomal transcripts in each tissue tested can be seen in Figure 5.Confirming the array findings, the majority of ribosomal genes were expressed significantly lower in LRRK2 KO than in LRRK2 G2019S in the kidney, cortex and striatum. Only Rps2 was significantly higher in the LRRK2 KO kidney when compared with both G2019S and WT, while no change was observed in the striatum and somewhat down-regulation in the LRRK2 KO cortex. Rpl15 and Rpl27a were consistently significantly regulated (P < 0.05) compared with matching controls (WT and NTg) in all tissues tested.LRRK2 modulates the expression of membrane-bound organelle, protein metabolism and mitochondrial genesWe ran similar gene set enrichment analyses on the gene set that were down-regulated in LRRK2 G2019S mice compared with KO. We found that genes associated with membrane-bound organelles were highly enriched in both brain regions (cortex, E-value 8.39E–07, 680 transcripts; striatum, E-value 1.82E–124, 410 transcripts). In the cortex, biological sets comprising ubiquitination processes were also highly significantly down-regulated in LRRK2 G2019 animals compared with KO, while in the striatum ER, oxidative phosphorylation, RNA processing and mitochondrial function were down-regulated. The kidney had only one pathway of borderline significance (sensory perception of smell; E-value 0.2; 34 overlapping genes, not shown) and muscle had none (Table 4).Additionally, using public brain expression data, Ingenuity and Metabase sources from targeted geoscience initiative, we found that in the striatum 116 of 410 transcripts identified for membrane-bound organelle (~30%) were interconnected. Two of 116 genes—Ctcf (CCCTC-binding factor known to promote histone methylation) and Zfx (zinc-finger protein X linked)—had most connections with other genes and thus were overrepresented (Supplementary Material). Similar patterns (interconnectivity and overrepresentation) were observed in the mouse cortex for ‘membrane-bound organelle’ function (not shown)."
28582927	Lrrk2 knockdown attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in microgliaAs a first step in examining the role of Lrrk2 in microglia, we developed stable murine Lrrk2 knockdown (Lrrk2-KD) microglia. For this, we infected BV-2 microglia with lentiviral particles encoding shRNAs targeting Lrrk2 or a non-targeting control shRNA. We chose two Lrrk2-KD clones and two control clones for these experiments. Lrrk2 mRNA and proteins levels were dramatically reduced in Lrrk2-KD microglia (Fig. 1A). We then analyzed the expression of the proinflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-1β, and iNOS following LPS treatment. In Lrrk2-KD clones, TNF-α and IL-6 secretion was significantly decreased at 3 and 24 hours compared to untransfected parental (−) cells and control clones (Fig. 1B). iNOS protein expression and NO production (detected as NO-derived nitrite by 48 hours after activation) were also significantly reduced in Lrrk2-KD clones at 24 and 48 hours (Fig. 1C, 1D). Consistent with the results, a qRT-PCR analysis showed that LPS (100 ng/mL)-induced expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS mRNA was dramatically reduced in Lrrk2-KD clones at 3 and 9 hours (Fig. 1E). A significant decrease in TNF-α mRNA expression was only detected at 3 hours since its expression reduced to the basal level at 9 hours (Fig. 1E). We further examined whether Lrrk2 affects other TLR receptors that have potentials to induce inflammatory response in BV-2 microglia [29]. Using agonists for TLR2 (lipoteichoic acid, LTA, 10 µg/ml), TLR-7/8 (CL097, 500 ng/ml), and TLR-9 (ODN1668, 500 ng/ml), we found that Lrrk2-KD could regulate inflammatory responses mediated by these TLRs since nitric oxide production induced by these TLR agonists were significantly reduced in Lrrk2 KD clones (Fig. 1F–H). Similar results were obtained in Drosophila LRRK (dLRRK) loss-of-function mutant, LRRKP1 [30]: mRNA expression of antimicrobial proteins, attacin A and diptericin, was significantly reduced in LRRKP1 compared to wild type Drosophilaat 5-, or 30-days (Figure S1). Taken together, these results indicate that LRRK2 is a positive regulator of inflammation.Lrrk2 knockdown specifically attenuates LPS-induced activation of p38 MAPK, but not JNK or ERKMAPKs are critical signaling molecules in LPS-induced microglial inflammatory processes [31]. Therefore, we examined whether activation of MAPKs was impaired in Lrrk2-KD microglia by analyzing phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK following LPS stimulation. Parental cells and control cells showed similar levels of phosphorylated MAPKs (Fig. 2A, 2B). Interestingly, the levels of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) were specifically attenuated in Lrrk2-KD cells between 15 and 60 min after LPS treatment compared to that in parental and control cells while the levels of p-ERK and p-JNK were not different (Fig. 2A, 2B). The other Lrrk2-KD clone also showed attenuated p-p38 levels in response to LPS (data not shown). Next, we analyzed activation of MKK3/6, an upstream kinase of p38 MAPK. In response to LPS, phosphorylation levels of serine 189/207 of MKK3/6 (p-MKK3/6) increased from 15 to 60 min (Fig. 2C). However, p-MKK3/6 levels were not significantly different in parental, control, and Lrrk2-KD cells (Fig. 2D, 2E).Lrrk2 knockdown attenuates LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and increases the DNA-binding activity of the NF-κB p50 subunitThe transcription factor NF-κB is important in mediating the expression of inflammatory genes in microglia [32]–[34]. To assess the function of Lrrk2 in the process of inflammatory activation, we analyzed the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in Lrrk2-KD microglia by measuring the activity of a luciferase reporter expressed under the control of a promoter containing five repeats of an NF-κB-binding sequence. LPS (100 ng/mL) increased luciferase activity by 3–4 fold in parental (−) and control cells; in contrast, luciferase activity was increased only 1–2 folds in both of Lrrk2-KD clones (Fig. 3A).We next analyzed the molecular mechanism responsible for Lrrk2-stimulated NF-κB transcriptional activity. Interestingly, degradation of IκB protein, a prerequisite event for nuclear translocation of NF-κB, was not different in control and Lrrk2-KD cells; in cells of both clonal types, IκB protein was decreased at approximately 30 min, but rebounded 60 min after LPS activation (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that diminished NF-κB transcriptional activity in Lrrk2-KD cells is mediated by disruption of a molecular mechanism downstream of IκB degradation.A further investigation of the mechanism of Lrrk2 regulation of NF-κB activity using EMSA analyses unexpectedly showed that both lower (Fig. 4A, arrow) and upper (Fig. 4A, arrowhead) NF-κB-DNA complexes, identified in supershift assays as p50/p50 homodimers and mainly p50/p65 heterodimers, respectively (Fig. 4B), were somewhat more strongly detected in Lrrk2-KD cells than in control cells between 15 and 60 min after LPS stimulation. It has been reported that, unlike p50/p65 heterodimers, p50/p50 homodimers function to inhibit transcription [35]. Thus, we analyzed nuclear proteins that bound to the NF-κB binding DNA consensus sequence. For this, we incubated nuclear extracts with a 5′-biotinylated DNA probe and then precipitated with streptavidin-agarose resin. Within 30 min, LPS induced the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 NF-κB subunits to a comparable degree in both Lrrk2-KD and control cells (Fig. 4C, Nuclear extract). Importantly, however, more p50 bound to DNA in Lrrk2-KD cells; p65 binding was not different in these two types of cells (Fig. 4C, DNA-binding). These results suggest that NF-κB transcriptional activity is reduced in Lrrk2-KD cells because the affinity of the inhibitory p50 subunit for the NF-κB consensus sequence is higher in these cells than in controls.Effect of overexpression of LRRK2-WT and LRRK2 mutants on LPS-induced inflammatory responsesWe next examined the effect of overexpression of hLRRK2 on LPS-induced activation of MAPKs and NF-κB using HEK293T cells. These cells were used because of low transfection efficiency of BV-2 microglia. Because parental HEK293T cells do not respond to LPS treatment [36], we transiently transfected HEK293T cells with expression plasmids for the LPS receptor, TLR4, and proteins of the downstream signaling machinery, CD14 and MD2 [37], [38]. In these LPS-responsive TCM-HEK cells, LPS induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK within 60 min (Fig. 5A). Thus, we analyzed the effect of LRRK2-WT and LRRK2 mutants on basal and LPS-induced p38 and JNK phosphorylation levels in TCM-HEK cells cotransfected with LRRK2-expression vectors or empty vector (mock). Overexpression of LRRK2-WT and all LRRK2 mutants, including kinase-active (G2019S), kinase-dead (D1994A), and WD-domain (G2385R) mutants, tended to increase basal levels of phosphorylated p38 compared to empty vector-transfected (mock) cells, although the extent of the increase varied depending on the specific LRRK2 variant. Basal levels of phosphorylated JNK were also increased by overexpression of LRRK2-WT and LRRK2-G2019S, but not by overexpression of LRRK2-D1994A or LRRK2-G2385R (Fig. 5B, 5C). LPS increased p38 and JNK phosphorylation in cells transfected with LRRK2-WT, LRRK2-G2019S, and in mock-transfected cells, but not in cells transfected with LRRK2-D1994A or LRRK2-G2385R (Fig. 5B, 5C). Notably, LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation was significantly increased in LRRK2-G2019S-expressing cells, and LPS-induced JNK phosphorylation was increased in LRRK2-WT and LRRK2-G2019S-expressing cells above the levels in mock cells (Fig. 5B, 5C). The kinase-active mutant G2019S, in particular, enhanced both basal and LPS-induced levels of phosphorylated (activated) p38 and JNK, whereas the effects of other LRRK2 mutants on p38 and JNK activation were variable. However, as in microglia, overexpression of LRRK2-WT, -G2019S, and -D1994A had no effects on p-MKK3/6 levels in TCM-HEK cells in the absence and presence of LPS (Fig. 5D).Next, we examined whether overexpression of LRRK2-WT or LRRK2 mutants modified NF-κB transcriptional activity. Expression of LRRK2-WT increased NF-κB transcriptional activity in HEK cells (left panel in Fig. 6A) as previously reported [16]. However, expression of TCM alone significantly enhanced NF-κB transcriptional activity in HEK cells (Fig. 6A), and co-expression of LRRK2-WT did not further increase NF-κB transcriptional activity (left panel in Fig. 6A). Expression of LRRK2 was confirmed with Western blot (right panel in Fig. 6A). Next, we evaluated the effect of overexpression of LRRK2-WT on LPS-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity in TCM-HEK cells: LRRK2-WT compared to empty vector enhanced LPS-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 6B). This increase in NF-κB activity was LPS-dose dependent in the range of 0.01–100 ng/mL, with maximum activity obtained with 1 ng/mL LPS (Fig. 6B). We further analyzed the effect of other LRRK2 mutants on NF-κB activity. Interestingly, all LRRK2 mutants (R1441C, G2019S, G2385R, and D1994A) significantly increased NF-κB activity, indicating that the increase was independent of mutations in ROC, kinase, and WD domains (Fig. 6C). In addition, G2019S showed dose-response at 100 and 250 ng, but not at 750 ng (Fig. 6D). G2385R also similarly increased NF-κB activity at 100 ng and 500 ng (Fig. 6D). Thus, the effect of Lrrk2 on NF-κB activity may be saturated at quite low Lrrk2 levels.Next, we further analyzed the effect of LRRK2 overexpression on the formation of NF-κB-DNA complexes in TCM-HEK cells since the p50 binding to the NF-κB consensus sequence increased in response to LPS in Lrrk2-KD microglia (Figs. 4 and 6E–F). However, there was no significant difference in NF-κB-DNA complex formation in LRRK2-overexpressing and vector-transfected (mock) cells between 30 min and 2 h after LPS activation (Fig. 6E, arrowhead). Supershift assay with p50 and p65 antibodies showed that the NF-κB-DNA complex is p50/p65 heterodimers, and no p50/p50 homodimer was detected in TCM-HEK cells (Fig. 6F).Taken together, the results of this study suggest that LRRK2 regulates inflammation in settings as diverse as murine microglia and TCM-HEK cells. Furthermore, p38 and JNK MAPK, and NF-κB signaling pathways are possible targets of LRRK2."
28582928	Generation of transgenic mice expressing mutant (G2019S) orwild-typeLRRK2In the present study, we prepared a PD animal model by generating transgenic mice expressing HA-tagged disease-causing (G2019S) LRRK2. As a control, transgenic mice expressing HA-tagged wild-type LRRK2 were also generated. Previous studies by us and others showed that a high level of PDGF-β promoter-mediated neuronal transgene expression was observed in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and SN.22, 23, 24 Furthermore, hybrid CMV enhancer/PDGF-β promoter mediated a high level of transgene expression in SNpc dopaminergic neurons.25 Therefore, the expression of (G2019S) or wild-type LRRK2HA in the transgenic mouse was under transcriptional control of CMV enhancer/PDGF-β promoter. Southern blot analysis was performed to identify founder animals expressing transgene (CMV enhancer/PDGF-β promoter-(G2019S) LRRK2HA or CMV enhancer/PDGF-β promoter-LRRK2HA) and determine approximate copy number. Two CMV enhancer/PDGF-βpromoter-(G2019S) LRRK2HA founder mice with a high copy number (10 copies) of transgene were used to establish two stable lines of (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice (lines 32 and 51). As a control, two lines of LRRK2 transgenic mice (lines 36 and 43) were also generated from two CMV enhancer/PDGF-β promoter-LRRK2HA founder mice with 10 copies of transgene.HA-tagged (G2019S) LRRK2 was expressed in various brain regions of (G2019S) LRRK2 mouse, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, SN, and striatum (Figure 1a). Similarly to (G2019S) LRRK2 mice, HA-tagged wild-type LRRK2 was found in several brain regions including the SN (Figure 1a) and striatum of LRRK2 transgenic mice. Protein level of wild-type LRRK2HA in the SN of LRRK2 mouse was similar to that of (G2019S) LRRK2HA in the SN of (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mouse (Figure 1a).Double immunofluorescence staining using anti-TH antiserum and anti-HA antibody was performed to visualize the expression of HA-tagged (G2019S) or wild-type LRRK2 in SNpc dopaminergic neurons. Consistent with a previous study reporting that CMV enhancer/PDGF-β promoter mediated transgene expression in SNpc dopaminergic cells,25 confocal microscopy showed that HA-tagged (G2019S) or wild-type LRRK2 was found in the cytoplasm of about 70% of SNpc TH-positive dopaminergic neurons in 10-month-old transgenic mice expressing (G2019S) or wild-type LRRK2 (Figure 1b; n=4 animals).(G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice exhibit progressive degeneration of SNpc dopaminergic neuronsImmunohistochemical TH staining was conducted to visualize degeneration of SNpc dopaminergic cells in 8- to 16-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice. The number of SNpc TH-positive dopaminergic cells of 8- to 9-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 mice (n=4 animals) was not significantly different from that of wild-type mice at the same age. Compared with 12-month-old wild-type mice, two lines of age-matched (G2019S) LRRK2 mice exhibited a significant reduction in the number of SNpc dopaminergic neurons (Figure 2a). Neuronal death of SNpc dopaminergic cells progressively deteriorated in 16-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice (Figure 2a). In contrast, the number of SNpc dopaminergic neurons was not significantly altered in two lines of 12- or 16-month-old transgenic mice expressing wild-type LRRK2 (Figure 2a).In addition to a loss of SNpc dopaminergic neurons, another common pathological hallmark of PD is the formation of intracytoplasmic protein aggregates termed as Lewy bodies, composed of the synaptic vesicle-associated protein α-synuclein, ubiquitin, and other components, in the surviving SN neurons.26 Immunocytochemical staining using monoclonal FK2 antiserum, which recognizes ubiquitinated proteins, anti-α-synuclein antibody or anti-phospho-α-synucleinSer129 antiserum failed to observe Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites in the SN of 12- to 16-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice (n=5 animals; data not shown).Tau pathology, caused by accumulation of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau with numerous Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites including Ser202 and Thr205, was found in PARK8 patients with (G2019S) LRRK2 mutation.13 Western blot analysis with AT8 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a tau epitope phosphorylated at Ser202 and Thr205, was performed to visualize phospho-tauSer202/Thr205expression in the brain of wild-type, LRRK2, or (G2019S) LRRK2 mouse. Protein level of phospho-tauSer202/Thr205 was increased in the SN of 12-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice (Figure 2b). In contrast, protein expression of phospho-tauSer202/Thr205 was not altered in the SN of transgenic mice expressing wild-type LRRK2 (Figure 2b). Protein level of phospho-tauSer202/Thr205 was not significantly altered in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum of 12-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 mice (n=5 animals; data not shown).Consistent with previous neuropathological studies of (G2019S) LRRK2 PD patients,12, 14, 15, 16 immunohistochemical staining of neuronal marker NeuN showed the absence of significant neuronal death in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum (Figure 2c) of 12- or 16-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice (n=5 animals).(G2019S) LRRK2-induced neuronal death of SNpc dopaminergic cells is expected to cause the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals. Therefore, microSPECT imaging of 99mTc-TRODAT, a tracer of presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT), was performed to visualize in-vivo DAT density in the striatum of mouse. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging studies demonstrated that striatal 99mTc-TRODAT uptake was significantly decreased in 12-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice as compared with age-matched wild-type mice (Figures 3A and B). Compared with 16-month-old control mice or transgenic mice expressing wild-type LRRK2, density of TH-immunoreactive staining was also decreased in the striatal sections of (G2019S) LRRK2 mice (Figures 3C and D).(G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice display progressive parkinsonism phenotypesSimilarly to hypokinesia exhibited by PD patients, 12-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice were less active, which was indicated by a significant reduction in measured spontaneous ambulatory activity (Figure 4a). The severity of reduced locomotor activity progressively increased in (G2019S) LRRK2 mice at 16 months of age (Figure 4a). In contrast, 12- or 16-month-old LRRK2 transgenic mice did not display the symptom of hypoactivity (Figure 4a).The pole test was also conducted to investigate the motor performance of mouse. Similarly to bradykinesia displayed by PD patients, animal with a lesion of SNpc dopaminergic neurons takes a longer time to perform the pole test.27 Twelve- or sixteen-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice exhibited an impaired motor performance and the phenomenon of bradykinesia, which was indicated by a significant increase in time required to perform the pole test (Figure 4b). The performance of LRRK2 transgenic mice in the pole test was similar to that of wild-type mice (Figure 4b).(G2019S) LRRK2 PD patients had a good response to ℒ-DOPA treatment.6 Therefore, we tested the possible beneficial effect of ℒ-DOPA on PD phenotype displayed by (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice. Compared with saline-treated wild-type mice, 12-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 mice injected with saline displayed a significant reduction in open-field locomotor activity measured by the distance traveled during the test period (Figure 4c). Similarly to PD patients with (G2019S) LRRK2 mutation, intraperitoneal administration of methyl ℒ-DOPA (2 mg/kg of body weight) reversed the hypoactivity exhibited by (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice (Figure 4c). Thus, (G2019S) LRRK2 mice prepared by us recapitulated (G2019S) LRRK2 PD patient′s clinical characteristics, progressive motor deficit, and responsiveness to ℒ-DOPA.(G2019S) LRRK2 exhibits an augmented kinase activity of phosphorylating MAPK kinase 4 at Ser 257(G2019S) LRRK2 mutation resulted in an augmented in-vitro kinase activity.15, 16, 17 Thus, it is very likely that (G2019S) LRRK2 mutation causes overphosphorylation of downstream substrates, aberrant activation of neuronal death signal pathway and resulting in degeneration of SNpc dopaminergic neurons in (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice.Recently, we performed quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis by quantifying differentially labeled phosphopeptides isolated from the SN of wild-type or (G2019S) LRRK2 mice and identified upregulated phosphoproteins, which are likely to be (G2019S) LRRK2 substrates, in the (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice. Interestingly, one of the identified phosphoproteins upregulated in the SN of (G2019S) LRRK2 mice was MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4) phosphorylated at Ser257 (Chen et al., unpublished results). LRRK2 is believed to be a member of MLK subfamily of MAPKKKs.18, 19 MLKs are known to activate neuronal death signal pathway by phosphorylating downstream MKK4 at Ser257. Therefore, we hypothesized that (G2019S) LRRK2 displays an augmented kinase activity of phosphorylating MKK4 at Ser257.To provide evidence that (G2019S) LRRK2 mutation augments kinase activity and causes aberrant phosphorylation of MKK4 at Ser257, cDNA of FLAG-tagged MKK4 was transfected into HEK 293 cells stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type or (G2019S) LRRK2 (Figure 5a). Subsequent immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody and western blot analysis using anti-phospho-MKK4Ser257 antiserum showed that when expressed in 293 cells expressing wild-type LRRK2, FLAG-tagged MKK4 was not significantly phosphorylated at Ser257 (Figure 5b). On the other hand, immunoprecipitated protein level of phospho-MKK4Ser257was greatly increased in 293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged MKK4 and (G2019S) LRRK2 (Figure 5b).(G2019S) LRRK2 activates MKK4-JNK-cJun pathway and promotes formation of active caspases in the SN of (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic miceConsistent with results observed in HEK 293 cells, immunoblotting study using anti-phospho-MKK4Ser257 antibody showed that protein level of active phospho-MKK4Ser257 was greatly increased in the SN of (G2019S) LRRK2 mice at the age of 12 months (Figures 6a and b). Protein expression of phospho-MKK4Ser257 was not significantly altered in the SN of transgenic mice expressing wild-type LRRK2 (Figure 6a).Activated phospho-MKK4Ser257 phosphorylates and activates downstream JNKs. Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-JNKThr183/Tyr185antiserum, which recognizes phosphorylated and activated JNKs, was performed to visualize JNK activation in the SN. Compared with wild-type mice, protein expression of active phospho-JNKThr183/Tyr185 was significantly upregulated in the SN of 12-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 mice (Figure 6a).A principal target of activated JNK is transcription factor c-Jun. The transcriptional activity of c-Jun is stimulated by JNK-mediated phosphorylation at Ser63, leading to increased expression of target genes that initiate the apoptotic cascade and caspase activation.18, 19 Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-c-JunSer63 antibody demonstrated the expected upregulated expression of active phospho-c-JunSer63 in the SN of (G2019S) LRRK2 transgenic mice at 12 months of age (Figure 6a).Active phospho-c-JunSer63 causes neuronal death by enhancing the transcription of Bim and FasL.28, 29, 30 Bim, a member of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, promotes cell death of CNS neurons including SNpc dopaminergic neurons by binding to Bcl-2 family pro-survival proteins and facilitating activation of Bax/Bak, which subsequently induces mitochondrial release of cytochrome-c and caspase-9 activation.31 By interacting with its cell surface receptor Fas, FasL promotes neuronal apoptosis via activating caspase-8.29 Consistent with our hypothesis that (G2019S) LRRK2 induces the activation and phosphorylation of c-Jun, mRNA expression of Bim or FasL was significantly upregulated in the SN of 12-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 mice (Figure 6b).JNK-c-Jun-Bim/FasL cascade induces the formation of active caspase-9 and caspase-8 and causes neuronal death by activating intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.29, 30, 31, 32 Therefore, it was hypothesized that (G2019S) LRRK2 causes degeneration of SNpc dopaminergic neurons in (G2019S) LRRK2 mice by promoting the formation of active caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3. In accordance with this hypothesis, protein level of cleaved active caspase-9, active caspase-8, or active caspase-3 was greatly increased in the SN of 12-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 mice (Figure 7a). Wild-type LRRK2 failed to induce the formation of active caspase-3, caspase-8, or caspase-9 in the SN of LRRK2 transgenic mice (Figure 7a). Confocal immunofluorescence imaging study further showed that active caspase-9 (Figure 7b; 27±3% TH-positive neurons; n=4 animals) and active caspase-3 (Figure 7c; 32±4% TH-positive cells; n=4 animals) were found in the cytoplasm of TH-positive SNpc dopaminergic neurons of 12-month-old (G2019S) LRRK2 mice. In contrast, the formation of active caspase-9 or caspase-3 was not observed in TH-positive SNpc dopaminergic cells of LRRK2 transgenic mice at the same age (Figures 7b and c; n=4 animals)."
28582930	Generation of murine LRRK2 knockout miceThe targeting strategy for generation of LRRK2 knockout (KO) mice is shown in Figure ​Figure1A.1A. Homozygous mice received from Ozgene PLC were bred to Jackson C57BL6/J mice and subsequent heterozygous offspring were bred together to obtain wild type (WT), heterozygous (HET) and KO animals. Northern blotting analysis with a probe designed to LRRK2 exon 24–27 confirmed the absence of the ~9 kb LRRK2 mRNA transcript in KO mice and a reduced transcript signal in the HET mice (Figure ​(Figure1B).1B). Similarly, immunoblotting confirmed absence of LRRK2 protein band in the KO mice and a diminished signal in HET mice (Figure ​(Figure1C).1C). Immunohistochemistry also revealed specific signal in the WT compared to KO (Figure ​(Figure11D).To determine if any compensatory mRNA changes occurred in the paralog LRRK1, we used quantitative Taqman assay with a probe to murine LRRK1 to compare WT, HET and KO mice. No significant alterations in LRRK1 mRNA levels were observed in any of the brain regions tested. We also checked mRNA levels of SNCA, MAPT or PARKIN and found no differences ( Additional file 1: Figure S1).LRRK2 KO mice were fertile and appeared to be healthy from birth, with body weights comparable to WT littermates within the study period. HET x HET breedings yielded Mendelian ratios in line with expected inheritance (from over 70 litters 24.4 % WT, 51.6 % HET, 24 % KO).Subsequent characterization experiments were performed to compare KO and WT mice at different aging time points. Due to animal costs and space restraints, we included a HET group in some, but not all, of these analyses.Dopaminergic system characterizationLRRK2 expression is normally found in high levels in the striatum so we reasoned that loss of LRRK2 may impact the functional integrity of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic pathway. To determine if dopamine neurons or their processes were altered in the substantia nigra, we performed stereological counts of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons and dendrites in KO and WT mice aged 18–20 months. No differences in neuronal estimates were observed between KO mice (mean estimate ± SEM; 13,766 ± 471) compared to their WT littermates (12,267 ± 481) (Figure ​(Figure2A).2A). Similarly, there were no differences between dendritic estimates for WT (149,763 ± 6213) and KO (153,873 ± 4351) (Figure ​(Figure2B).2B). Next, we examined dopamine axonal neurochemistry by analyzing total dopamine content in striatal lysates by HPLC from 10 month and 18 month KO mice and WT littermates (Figure ​(Figure2C-G,2C-G, data shown only for 18 months) and found dopamine and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA) levels were equivalent in KO and WT animals at both time points.Since total striatal dopamine includes dopamine that is stored, synthesized, released and taken up, we hypothesized that we may observe differences in KO mice by investigating these mechanisms independently. First, we performed microdialysis to measure extracellular release of dopamine in vivo. Extracellular dopamine levels were measured before and after KCl-evoked dopamine response in WT, HET and KO mice aged 3–4 months of age (Figure ​(Figure2H).2H). Baseline levels of dopamine were not found to differ between WT (0.13 ± 0.06 pg/μl), HET (0.15 ± 0.06 pg/μl) or KO mice (0.16 ± 0.07 pg/μl). When post-KCl dopamine levels were normalized to the average of their individual basal dopamine levels (i.e. % response) no significant differences were observed (Figure ​(Figure2I).2I). Next, we examined dopamine uptake in the WT, HET and KO mice using a radioactive uptake assay with [3H] dopamine. Uptake was comparable across the three groups suggesting a functionally intact dopamine transporter ( Additional file 2: Figure S2A). Concluding that release, storage and uptake of dopamine appear to be normal, we then examined D2-autoreceptor mediated synthesis and release, which is one of the feedback mechanisms in the striatum. It is well known that antagonizing pre-synaptic D2 autoreceptors can remove this feedback inhibition and cause increased synthesis as well as release of dopamine [24]. WT, HET and KO mice were treated with the D2 receptor antagonist raclopride, sacrificed 30 min later and HPLC analysis performed to quantify dopamine and metabolites. As expected, dopamine turnover, as measured by the ratio of dopamine metabolites to stores of dopamine increased dramatically [One way ANOVA ps < 0.0001 for DOPAC/dopamine and HVA/dopamine] following treatment with raclopride ( Additional file 2: Figure S2B, C). However, Tukey’s post hoc comparisons did not reveal differences in this response between WT, HET or KO mice, suggesting that autoreceptor-mediated feedback is normal in the absence of LRRK2. A significant increase in levels of serine-40 phosphorylated TH after raclopride treatment was also observed (indicating increased synthesis), but this response was not different between WT, HET or KO mice (data not shown). Finally, we examined striatal receptor density for both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors by autoradiography in 10 and 18 month old WT and KO mice and no differences were observed ( Additional file 3: Figure S3A-D).Analysis of striatal dendritic spinesWe have previously shown that LRRK2 G2019S transgenic mice have impaired neurite outgrowth in vitro[25] and in vivo[26] as well as a reduced number of mature spines in the hippocampus [26]. We have also reported that neurite outgrowth was increased in both midbrain and hippocampal cultures derived from LRRK2 KO mice [25]. As LRRK2 has previously been linked to ERM proteins and the actin cytoskeleton [27-31] we hypothesized that the loss of LRRK2 in the striatum in KO mice, an area where it is normally highly expressed, may impact on striatal dendritic spines. We counted spine number in Golgi-Cox labeled medium spiny neurons (MSN) of brains from aged (18+ months) KO and WT mice. Spines were classified into different morphological types [32]. No differences were found in spine numbers between in KO and WT mice suggesting that lack of LRRK2 has no effect on MSN spine dynamics in vivo ( Additional file 4: Figure S4).Proliferation / Neurogenesis studiesAs LRRK2 is normally expressed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and proliferation, neurogenesis and migration are impaired in G2019S BAC mice [26], we sought to ascertain whether loss of expression has an impact on cell proliferation. We analyzed the effect of loss of LRRK2 on newly generated cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus after a single injection of BrdU. Unbiased stereological counting methods were applied to estimate the number of BrdU-labeled cells. No differences were observed in proliferation between KO and WT mice ( Additional file 5: Figure S5A). Since doublecortin (DCX) expression levels in adult brain reflect neurogenesis [33], we also performed counts on DCX labeled neurons in the hippocampus and these were also found to be comparable in KO and WT mice ( Additional file 5: Figure S5B) suggesting normal neurogenesis occurs in KO mice.NeuropathologyHameotoxylin and eosin revealed morphology of KO mouse brains to be normal up to 20 months of age. To assess mice for neuropathological alterations we examined young (3–6 months), middle aged (10–13 months) and aged (18+ months) WT, HET and KO mice for a variety of markers associated with Parkinson’s disease pathology including alpha-synuclein, tau and Iba-1. In agreement with a previous report [34], no overt differences were observed with any of these markers between WT, HET and KO mice. As we have previously shown alterations in tau regulation in our BAC mutant LRRK2 G2019S model, we performed quantitative immunoblotting with tau antibodies (tau-5, CP-13 and tau-1) in lysates from aged WT and KO mice. Our results indicate that tau regulation is normal in KO mice ( Additional file 6: Figure S6).Behavioral AnalysisOpen-field TestIn the initial characterization, we focused on the analysis of spontaneous exploratory locomotor behavior evaluated in the open-field test. The open-field test assesses spontaneous exploration of mice as well as their emotional response after being exposed to much larger than a home cage and brightly illuminated unfamiliar environment [35-37]. The rationale behind this approach was based on evidence that anxiety disorders, which affect about 40 % of PD patients [38,39] and other psychiatric symptoms can precede the onset of motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability in PD by decades [39]. The open-field test, which combines the evaluation of anxiety as well as spontaneous locomotor activity, therefore presents an appropriate paradigm for the phenotyping characterization of the KO mice. The test has been successfully used with other familial Parkinson disease mouse models, for example mice deficient in parkin gene [40].We characterized the behavior of KO and WT mice in the open-field test, adopting longitudinal experimental design, at a young (7 months) and older (16 months) time point. The evaluation was done in one 5-min session at each age in order to minimize the saving effect and habituation to the test due to repeated testing. Data was analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA followed by Student’s t-tests for independent samples (to assess the genotype effect at each testing age) and matched-pairs samples (to assess the age effect within each genotype).Overall analysis of the exploration of the open-field arena by KO and WT mice revealed no differences in the length of walking distance, walking speed or onset of exploration between the genotypes. The KO mice tended to spend more time on longer (> 5 s) rests than WT mice during their exploration (p < 0.05, ANOVA, genotype effect), however, high variability of this behavior did not yield significant differences at α = 0.05 at each age of testing (Figure ​(Figure3A).3A). The number of rests and shorter (< 5 s) stops did not differ between the genotypes.Mice of both genotypes explored the center of the arena less at 16 months than at 7 months test (15.9 s ± 1.6 for 16-month and 25.0 s ± 3.5 for 7-month mice respectively, p < 0.001, ANOVA, age effect). However, KO mice explored the center of the open-field arena significantly less than the WT mice (15.0 % ± 2.4 and 25.9 % ± 2.8 of time averaged across age for KO and WT mice respectively, p < 0.01, ANOVA, genotype effect). The difference was significant at both at 7 (p < 0.05, t-test) and 16 (p < 0.01, t-test) months of age (Figure ​(Figure33B).This shorter time of exploration of the inner area of the field by the KO mice was likely due to their increased thigmotaxic (wall hugging) behavior (p < 0.001, ANOVA, genotype effect). The KO mice spent between 18 % to 87 % and 53 % to 91 % of their exploratory activity moving within close proximity of the wall during 7- and 16-month tests respectively. In contrast, the WT controls showed thigmotaxic behavior within a range of 9 % to 48 % and 36 % to 66 % during respective tests. Representative examples of the exploratory paths, reflecting the differences in the thigmotaxic behavior, are presented in Figure ​Figure4.4. Overall, the thigmotaxic behavior increased with age (p < 0.001, ANOVA age effect), with no significant interaction between the genotype and age factors. The differences in thigmotaxic behavior between the genotypes were significant at both 7 (p < 0.01, t-test) and at 16 (p < 0.001, t-test) months of age (Figure ​(Figure33C).Our analysis also revealed that overall, the exploratory paths of KO mice were less curvy and tortuous as compared to the paths of the WT counterparts (p < 0.001, ANOVA, genotype effect) and path tortousity was lower in mice of both genotypes during tests at 16 months (p < 0.001, ANOVA, age effect). The specific comparisons revealed a significant genotype effect on path tortuosity only at 16 months (p < 0.001, t-test, Figure ​Figure33D).Lastly, the KO mice approached an object placed in the center of the arena with longer latencies than WT mice (p < 0.05, ANOVA, genotype effect). In general, KO mice tended to spend less time exploring the object than WT mice (averaged across age 4.96 ± 0.09 and 9.45 ± 0.15 seconds respectively, p = 0.06, ANOVA, genotype effect). The borderline significance of the genotype effect was due to high variability in this behavior at 7-months (Figure ​(Figure3E).3E). At 16 months, however, the KO mice explored the object significantly less (p <0.05, t-test, Figure ​Figure3E).3E). The KO mice also approached the object less frequently (p < 0.05, ANOVA, genotype effect), with significant differences at each age of testing (ps < 0.05, t-test for 7 and 16 months, Figure ​Figure3F).3F). All mice approached the object less frequently when tested at the older age (p < 0.05, ANOVA, age effect).In summary, our results indicate that the KO mice showed abnormal spontaneous exploratory behavior in the open-field test, which was characterized by significantly higher thigmotaxic exploration of the arena. This result might be indicative of increased anxiety in the KO mice. Thigmotaxic behavior has been previously reported as a reliable measure of anxiety in the pre-clinical studies testing anxiolytic drugs [41]. In spite of the observed differences, we interpret these results cautiously, since most of the open-field test measures are interdependent [37]. We focused our emphasis on thigmotaxic behavior since it is likely that the initial prevalent engagement in this behavior affects other measures, like the exploration of inner area (r2 = 0.49, and r2 = 0.72 for 7 and 16 months respectively, ps = 0.001), and path tortuosity (r2 = 0.38 – 7 months, and r2 = 0.45 – 16 months, ps < 0.001).Motor testsNext, in a separate 7 month old cohort, we examined motor behavior in KO mice and compared this to both WT and HET littermates. Motor co-ordination/balance was examined by rotarod performance and gait was examined by digigait footprint analysis. Since the weights of the mice in each genotype did not differ significantly (p > 0.2, ANOVA), body weight was not used as a covariate in the analysis [42]. Analysis of performance on an accelerating rod revealed significant differences between the groups (p < 0.02, ANOVA). Subsequent, post-hoc analysis revealed that KO mice performed significantly better than their WT littermates, spending ~20 % (p < 0.01, Tukey’s test) longer on the rod (Figure ​(Figure55).The gait analysis was performed at three different speeds (14, 18 and 24 cm/sec) and compared a number of spatial and temporal indices between WT, HET and KO mice. Overall, there were no significant differences between the genotypes for stride lengths or any other of the recorded indices (Table ​(Table1)1) suggesting gait and thus striatal function remains intact.Inflammatory and degenerative alterations in kidney of LRRK2 KO miceTwo groups have previously identified abnormalities in the kidneys of LRRK2 KO mice including morphological changes, lysosomal and autophagic alterations, vacuolization and accumulation of pigment [34,43]. We examined kidneys from mice aged 3 to 20 months and also observed coloration (darkening) changes beginning as early as 3 months (Figure ​(Figure6A).6A). Significant enlargement was observed in the kidneys from the oldest mice (mean ± SEM; for KO female 0.23 ± 0.01 g and female WT 0.19 ± 0.01 g, p < 0.05 t-test; male KO 0.35 ± 0.02 g and male WT 0.22 ± 0.01 g, p < 0.001 t-test). At the gross level, kidneys from HET mice did not differ from WT counterparts (Figure ​(Figure6A)6A) therefore we limited subsequent analysis to KO and WT. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed inflammatory abnormalities, vacuolization and pigmentation in KO kidneys as young as 3 months, which was progressive with age (Figure ​(Figure6B).6B). We performed histological staining for a number of different markers including p62 (an ubiquitin-binding protein involved in cell signaling, oxidative stress and autophagy, found to be upregulated in many neurodegenerative diseases), Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain for glycoproteins, iron (Gomori's Prussian blue) and melanin (Fontana-Masson) staining for pigment and immunohistochemistry for PD related proteins alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin. The KO kidney pigment was negative for iron and melanin. PAS staining revealed abnormal granular staining reminiscent of lipofuscin in the proximal tubules of KO mice as young as 3 months of age, progressing at 12 months and becoming severe by 18 months (data not shown). These granular inclusions were also autofluorescent, the intensity increasing with age (Figure ​(Figure6B).6B). Increased p62 immunostaining in the same cells in KO mice was observed as early as 3 months of age, although quantitative differences were not detectable by immunoblot at this age (Figure ​(Figure7).7). The intensity of p62 immunostaining progressed with age, and by 12 months quantitative differences were evident. By 18 months the KO mice had on average a 15-fold increase (p < 0.01, t-test) in immunoblot relative band density compared to WT controls (Figure ​(Figure7).7). We were unable to corroborate the previous reports of increases in alpha-synuclein or ubiquitin [34,44] in KO mice neither by immunohistochemistry nor by immunoblotting.To further examine the granular pathology at the ultra-structural level, we performed electron microscopy in kidneys from 18 months old KO and WT mice (Figure ​(Figure6C).6C). Tubular epithelial cells in the renal cortex of KO kidney were found to contain degenerating debris and accumulation of pigment resembling lipofuscin, both absent from WT kidney. Although the debris was significant, some normal tubular epithelial cells were still present and no evidence of abnormal mitochondria was found. Following on from conflicting reports of impaired/biphasic or no change autophagy in LRRK2 KO mice [34,43,44] we performed immunoblotting with LC-3 antibody in kidney lysates from mice aged 3, 12 and 18 months old. No significant differences were seen at the 3 and 12 month time-point. However in KO mice aged 18 months we observed a significant 2.8 fold increase in intensity of the LC-3 II band (p < 0.05, t-test) indicating an increase, rather than the previously reported decrease."
28582932	Co-immunoprecipitation of LRRK2 and α-synucleinIn order to investigate the interaction between LRRK2 and α-synuclein, we used mouse brain samples from WT and LRRK2 knockout animals. The immunoprecipitation of α-synuclein from mouse brain lysates pulled down LRRK2 in WT samples, but not in knockout samples (Fig. 1a). We also verified the interaction between LRRK2 and α-synuclein when the immunoprecipitations were performed in human brain lysates (data not shown).In order to investigate whether LRRK2 mutations alter the interaction with α-synuclein, we over-expressed WT or G2019S mutant LRRK2 together with α-synuclein in HEK-293 cells. Immunoprecipitation of LRRK2 from cells over-expressing Myc-LRRK2 (WT or G2019S mutant) together with α-synuclein pulled down α-synuclein (Fig. 1b). Consistently, when α-synuclein was immunoprecipitated, the LRRK2 proteins (WT and G2019S) were also co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1c). We did not find significant alterations in the pattern of co-immunoprecipitation between WT and G2019S mutant, indicating that the interaction between the two proteins is not disturbed by this mutation.Co-localization of LRRK2 and α-synuclein in PD brain and cell modelPD brain samples were examined to determine whether LRRK2 and α-synuclein or phosphorylated α-synuclein were co-localized. We found that LRRK2 increases along with α-synuclein in neurons prior to Lewy body formation (Fig. 2a) as well as depositing in some but not all of the hallmark inclusions (Fig. 2b–d). LRRK2 was also observed in phosphorylated α-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions, often centralized to a radiating pattern of phosphorylated α-synuclein fibrils (Fig. 2f–h). Quantitation of the numbers of α-synuclein inclusions immunopositive for LRRK2 in ten PD cases (Table 1) indicates that 60 % of cingulate Lewy bodies and 43 % of nigral Lewy bodies contained both proteins (Fig. 2b, c). The specificity of the co-localization can be taken as genuine, as no 280-kDa LRRK2 band was detected on Western blot and no immunoreactivity in tissue sections in peptide pre-absorption experiments (see Supplementary Figure). There was no correlation between the number of α-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies and those also containing LRRK2 across the cases examined.We also interrogated an in vitro model that reproduces the formation of α-synuclein inclusions in H4 cells [17]. Using this model, we observed co-localization of endogenous LRRK2 with the α-synuclein-positive inclusions (Fig. 2e).Knocking down LRRK2 expression reduces α-synuclein aggregationTo further investigate the effect of LRRK2 on α-synuclein aggregation, LRRK2 expression was knocked down using shRNAs in the H4 cell model. Knocking down LRRK2 expression did not produce significant changes in endogenous α-synuclein or phosphorylated α-synuclein levels (Fig. 3a). Transiently transfecting these LRRK2-deficient cells with SynT and synphilin-1 expression plasmids showed that LRRK2 silencing significantly increased the number and decreased the size of α-synuclein inclusions resulting in a greater number of cells bearing smaller α-synuclein inclusions (Fig. 3b–d).Correlations between the levels of α-synuclein and LRRK2 in PDTo explore the relationship between protein levels of LRRK2 and α-synuclein in PD, 20 cases (controls and Braak PD stages IV and V, Supplementary Table) were analysed. Multivariate analysis factoring in age and post-mortem delay showed that the levels of total and phosphorylated α-synuclein were significantly increased over control levels only in PD brain regions with Lewy bodies (p < 0.001). In the cases examined, all stage IV cases had high Lewy body densities in the amygdala (Fig. 4a), while significant densities of cingulate Lewy bodies were observed in all stage V cases (Fig. 4b). No Lewy bodies were seen in the visual cortex of any case, although very small phosphorylated deposits were observed in stage V cases (Fig. 4c). In PD, there was a substantial 220 ± 20 % increase over controls in α-synuclein protein levels in the amygdala and a less substantial 48 ± 6 % increase in the cingulate cortex, with no change in the visual cortex (Fig. 4d, e). This pattern of regional increase in α-synuclein levels was even more striking when assessing phosphorylated α-synuclein protein levels (p = 0.01), as very low levels of phosphorylated α-synuclein were observed across all regions in controls compared to PD (Fig. 4e). There was a very large 60 ± 18-fold increase in phosphorylated α-synuclein protein levels in the PD amygdala, a 32 ± 4-fold increase in the PD cingulate cortex and an 8 ± 3-fold change in the PD visual cortex relative to controls (Fig. 4d, e).The expression of LRRK2 was analysed using the same methods in the same brain extracts (Fig. 5). Multivariate analysis co-varying for age or post-mortem delay showed that the levels of LRRK2 were increased in PD compared with controls in regions containing Lewy bodies (p < 0.04), with no difference between the LRRK2 levels in these Lewy body-containing regions (p = 0.6). Within these regions, there was a small but significant 23 ± 6 % increase over controls in full-length LRRK2 levels (Fig. 5a, b).To determine the relationship between LRRK2 and α-synuclein levels and PD, linear regression modelling was used assessing the protein levels obtained in the amygdala and cingulate cortex. This analysis revealed that increasing levels of LRRK2 and total and phosphorylated α-synuclein correlated with each other in PD but not controls (Fig. 5c, p < 0.001, β coefficients = 0.27, 0.33 and 0.37, respectively)."
28582933	To determine whether LRRK2 mutants affected mitochondrial homeostasis, we measured the percent mitochondrial content [100 × (mitochondrial area/cytoplasmic area)] in the axons, dendrites, and soma of cortical neurons co-expressing COX8-GFP with LRRK2-WT, LRRK2-G2019S, or LRRK2-R1441C (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure S1). Neurons were counterstained for MAP2 to distinguish dendrites from axons (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure S2A). We found that LRRK2 PD-associated mutants, but not WT LRRK2, caused significant reductions in mitochondrial content in dendrites, but not axons, at 5 days after transfection (Figure 1, B and E, and Supplemental Figure S2A). The LRRK2-G2019S mutant also caused a significant decrease in somatic mitochondrial content that was not observed with the LRRK2-R1441C mutant (Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure S2B), although the LRRK2 plasmids resulted in equivalent protein expression (Supplemental Figure S2C). There were no morphological changes to dendrites at this time point (Figure 1C), indicating that the decrease in mitochondria density preceded subsequent reductions in dendritic area observed at 14 days after transfection.23 The kinase-deficient LRRK2 K1906M mutant had no effect on dendritic mitochondrial content (Supplemental Figure S3A). Because decreased dendritic mitochondrial content could underlie the dendrite/neurite retraction observed in culture and mouse models of LRRK2-related PD,19,22,23,25 we further investigated causes of this decrease in mitochondrial content. Mitochondrial trafficking is one process that could regulate the quantity of mitochondria by delivering or removing mitochondria from the dendrites. To determine whether LRRK2 mutants affected mitochondrial trafficking, we measured anterograde (away from the soma) and retrograde (toward the soma) movement of COX8-GFP–labeled mitochondria in dendrites at 2 to 5 days after transfection. The percentage of mobile mitochondria was not significantly changed between treatment conditions (eg, at 5 days, vector = 15.64 ± 0.42, WT = 15.71 ± 0.11, G2019S = 17.52 ± 1.41, and R1441C = 16.74 ± 1.64; P = 0.454). The ratio of anterograde/retrograde moving mitochondria per cell was likewise not significantly altered (Figure 2A). There was a trend toward a greater spread of faster-moving anterograde mitochondria in LRRK2-transfected neurons, but this did not result in significant alterations in the average anterograde (Figure 2B) or retrograde (Figure 2C) velocities in vector versus LRRK2 (WT or mutant) expressing neurons. Because significant changes in mitochondrial trafficking were not observed, we investigated the potential role of mitochondrial degradation. We first measured the levels of steady-state autophagy in cortical neurons expressing mutant LRRK2. The microtubule-associated protein LC3 is a key autophagy mediator that covalently attaches to autophagosome membranes.40 By using GFP fused to LC3 (GFP-LC3), we investigated whether mutant LRRK2 altered the number of autophagosomes. Mutant LRRK2 caused an increase in autophagosomes compared with vector control (Figure 2D). To determine whether autolysosomal degradation contributed to the decrease in dendritic mitochondria, we inhibited lysosomal degradation with bafilomycin A using nontoxic doses previously shown to stabilize LC3-II from degradation,41,42 and confirmed using Western blot analysis and the tandem tfLC3 flux reporter42 (Supplemental Figure S3, B–D). The inhibition of autophagic degradation prevented the loss of dendritic mitochondria in neurons expressing mutant LRRK2 (Figure 2E). To further assess the involvement of autophagy, SH-SY5Y cells were used because they recapitulated the mutant LRRK2 effects observed in neurons (ie, increased autophagosomes,12,19 neurite shortening,12,19 and the selective reduction in the mitochondrial content of neurites) (Figure 2F), with no changes observed in the cell body for percentage of cytoplasmic area occupied by mitochondria (vector = 12.50 ± 0.54, WT = 14.56 ± 0.64, G2019S = 11.31 ± 0.64, and R1441C = 13.45 ± 0.83; P = 0.10). The inhibition of autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells using RNAi against ATG7, a protein essential for autophagy induction, also reversed the effects of LRRK2 mutants on neuritic mitochondrial density (Figure 2F).Because mitochondrial depolarization triggers mitochondrial degradation through autophagy (mitophagy) under multiple conditions,6,43,44 we assessed whether LRRK2 mutants affected mitochondrial inner membrane polarization. LRRK2 mutants, but not WT LRRK2, caused a significant decrease in dendritic mitochondrial polarization measured by TMRM staining 3 days after transfection (Figure 3, A and B). At this early time point, there was no change in mitochondrial content (Figure 3C), indicating that decreases in mitochondrial polarization preceded the dendritic mitochondrial loss seen after 5 days. Calcium homeostasis is essential for both neuronal and mitochondrial function, and aberrant elevations in intracellular calcium could lead to mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction.45 In addition to the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria contribute to the maintenance of neuronal calcium homeostasis.45,46 Because calcium metabolism and mitochondrial function are intrinsically linked,47 we investigated whether calcium metabolism was perturbed in neurons expressing mutant LRRK2. First, we measured the levels of intracellular calcium with Fura2-AM in transfected neurons after KCl stimulation. There was no difference in the peak intracellular calcium level after stimulation; however, there was a significant decrease in calcium signal recovery in neurons expressing mutant LRRK2 (Figure 4, A–C). The calcium signal recovery is affected by calcium channel inactivation and calcium efflux due to sequestration into organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria, and pumping across the plasma membrane. To eliminate the channel inactivation component, we directly measured total calcium efflux from the cytoplasm as the rate of calcium signal decay after removal of KCl. The time constant (τ) of calcium efflux was used as a measure of its efficacy. We found that calcium efflux from the cytoplasm was significantly less efficient in mutant LRRK2-expressing neurons (Figure 4, D and E). To determine whether the mitochondrial status was responsible for the delayed calcium signal recovery, we measured the τ of calcium efflux in mutant LRRK2-expressing neurons treated with the mitochondrial proton uncoupler, CCCP (Figure 5, A and B). Mitochondrial depolarization by CCCP eliminated the difference in the τ of calcium efflux between neurons expressing mutant LRRK2 (relative) and either vector or WT LRRK2 (Figure 5B), implicating a role for altered mitochondrial handling of calcium in the pathophysiological characteristics of mutant LRRK2. To determine whether calcium dysregulation contributed to the increased turnover of mitochondria elicited by mutant LRRK2, we measured the mitochondrial membrane potential in neurons treated with the calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM. Treatment with BAPTA-AM prevented mitochondrial depolarization caused by mutant LRRK2 (Figure 5C). Furthermore, BAPTA-AM prevented elevations in autophagy and mitochondrial degradation in neurons and SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 5, D, E, and G), suggesting that mutant LRRK2-elicited deficits in calcium homeostasis led to mitochondrial depolarization and mitophagy. Calcium chelation was also sufficient to reverse the subsequent neurite shortening elicited by mutant LRRK2 in both neurons and SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 5, F and H).To identify the calcium pools involved in mutant LRRK2-induced mitochondrial degradation, we treated neurons with EGTA to chelate extracellular calcium. Similar to BAPTA-AM, EGTA prevented the reduction in the percentage of dendritic area occupied by mitochondria (vector = 32.87 ± 4.57, WT = 35.18 ± 2.79, G2019S = 30.55 ± 3.12, and R1441C = 32.14 ± 3.35; P = 0.78), suggesting that extracellular calcium influx was required for mutant LRRK2-induced mitophagy in unstimulated cultures. Because primary cortical neurons exhibited spontaneous synaptic activity,48 we studied whether voltage-gated calcium channel inhibition would prevent the calcium influx–induced mutant LRRK2 phenotype. There are three families of voltage-gated calcium channels: the Cav1 (L-type), the Cav2 (P/Q-, N-, and R-types), and the Cav3 (T-type). The L- and T-types are primarily located in the somatodendritic compartment, whereas the P/Q-, N-, and R-type channels are found, to some extent, in both axonal and somatodendritic compartments.49 T-type channels primarily facilitate small, transient currents, whereas the other channels underlie larger calcium fluxes. Therefore, we assessed whether inhibiting L-type or P/Q-, N-, and R-type channels would modulate mutant LRRK2-induced mitochondrial degradation.We found that nitrendipine, an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, prevented mitochondrial degradation in neurons expressing mutant LRRK2 (Figure 6A). However, a mixture of NiCl2, ω-agatoxin, and ω-conotoxin that inhibit N-, P/Q-, and R-type calcium channels, respectively, was effective only in the R1441C model (Figure 6A). Furthermore, inhibition of L-type calcium channels and, to a lesser extent, N-, P/Q-, and R-type calcium channels prevented dendritic shortening caused by mutant LRRK2 (Figure 6B). Together, these results suggested that altered calcium homeostasis in mutant LRRK2-expressing neurons contributed to mitochondrial depolarization, mitophagy, and dendritic shortening. By normalizing the intracellular levels of calcium via voltage-gated calcium channel inhibitors, we prevented the mitophagy and dendritic shortening caused by mutant LRRK2."
28582934	2.1. Deficiency on mRNA and protein level in LRRK2 KOmiceTo confirm successful LRRK2 gene knockout, we performed in situ hybridization on coronal brain sections from LRRK2 KOmice and wildtype (WT) littermate controls using an mRNA probe for endogenous mouse LRRK2. As previously described in WT mice, LRRK2 mRNA was detected in the striatum and the piriform cortex, and at lower levels in cortical areas and in the hippocampus (Galter et al., 2006). In contrast the in situ hybridization on brain sections from homozygous LRRK2 KO mice resulted in a remarkably reduced LRRK2 signal, while some weak signal was still visible in the outer cortex layers and CA1 (Fig. 1B, D). Additionally, Lrrk2 protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting brain lysates from LRRK2 KO mice and WT littermate controls. In contrast to homo- genates of WT littermate controls, the monoclonal anti-Lrrk2 antibody visualized no protein band at the expected mole- cular weight on immunoblots of brain lysates from LRRK2 KO mice (Fig. 2, see lanes 4–6).2.2.        Proliferation of neural precursor cells in the adultDG is unchanged in LRRK2 KO miceWe analyzed the effect of LRRK2 deficiency on newly gener- ated cells in the hippocampal DG 24 h after two 5-bromo-2- deoxyuridine (BrdU) injections. Proliferation was comparable,as the total number of BrdUþ newly generated cells in the SGZ  showed  no  significant  difference  between  LRRK2  KOmice and their  WT littermate controls  (Control  8117105;LRRK2 KO 667766; p ¼ 0.27; Fig. 3B), indicating no effect on cell proliferation in the DG.2.3.        Survival of newly generated cells in the adult DG isunchanged in LRRK2 KO miceCell survival in the DG was analyzed four weeks after the last BrdU injection in a second group of animals receiving BrdUover five consecutive days. The total number of BrdUþ cells inthe DG showed no difference between LRRK2 KO mice andWT littermate controls (Control 5367178; LRRK2 KO 380793;p ¼ 0.46; Fig. 4B), indicating no overall effect on cell survival in the DG. We further assessed proliferation in this experimen-tal  survival  paradigm  using  the  endogenous  proliferation marker Ki67 and confirmed no significant changes in prolif- eration between the LRRK2 KO group and their WT littermatecontrols   (Control   306775;   LRRK2   KO   390730;   p ¼ 0.34).Measurement of the DG volume showed no significant dif- ference  between the  LRRK2  KO  group  and  WT  littermatecontrols (Control 0.4470.02; LRRK2 KO 0.3970.02; p ¼ 0.053). Volumes  are  represented  in  mm3 Â 10À9.  Normalization  of BrdU as well as Ki67 cell counts to the volume of the DG didnot alter the results, indicating an unchanged density of BrdUþ and Ki67þ cells in the DG of LRRK2 KO mice (see Table 1).2.4.        Expression profile of surviving BrdUþ cells: increasedimmature neuronal fate in the absence of changes in the mature neuronal fate in LRRK2 KO miceAdult neurogenesis was studied by determining the neuronalfate of BrdU labeled cells. Using confocal microscopy, BrdUþ cells in the DG were analyzed for double labeling with theimmature  neuronal  marker  doublecortin  (DCX)  and  the mature neuronal marker Neuronal specific Nuclear protein (NeuN; Fig. 5A, B). The percentage of early neuronal differ-entiation of BrdUþ cells, i.e. BrdUþ/DCXþ cells out of the total BrdUþ  cell  population  was  significantly  increased  in  the LRRK2 KO group compared to WT littermate controls (Control1773%;  LRRK2  KO  3074%;  p ¼ 0.04;  Fig.  5C).  Likewise,  by normalization of the total number of BrdUþ/DCXþ neuro- blasts to the volume of the DG the density of double labeled neuroblasts  was  significantly  increased  in  the  LRRK2  KO group   compared   to   WT   littermate   controls   (Control99.6724.8; LRRK2 KO 186.8716; p ¼ 0.018). Values are repre- sented as cells/mm3 Â 109. Also LRRK2 KO mice displayed a tendency for increased mature neuronal differentiation ofBrdUþ cells as the percentage of BrdUþ/NeuNþ cells out of the total BrdUþ cell pool appeared higher in the LRRK2 KO group compared to WT littermate controls without reachingsignificance level (Control 4276%; LRRK2 KO 6278%; p ¼ 0.08;Fig. 5B). In parallel, normalizing the total number of BrdUþ/ NeuNþ neurons to the volume of the DG we did not observe significant differences in the neuronal density of LRRK2 KOmice compared to WT littermate controls (Control 448774; LRRK2  KO  7077298;  p ¼ 0.42).  Values  are  represented  as cells/mm3 Â 109.2.5.        Total number of DCXþ hippocampal neuroblastsin the adult DG is increased in LRRK2 KO miceAdult hippocampal neurogenesis was further characterized by  quantifying  the  total  number  of  immature  migrating neuroblasts expressing the early neuronal marker DCX in the DG. As previously shown in (Schulz et al., 2011), thenumber of DCXþ neuroblasts in the DG was significantly increased  by  48.6%  in  LRRK2  KO  mice  compared  to  WT littermate controls (Control 28917203; LRRK2 KO 42977325;p ¼ 0.006; Fig. 6A). Likewise, by normalization to the volume of the DG the density of DCXþ neuroblasts was significantly increased  in  LRRK2  KO  mice  compared  to  WT  littermatecontrols (Table 1). Representative overviews of the DG illus-trate the increased number of DCXþ cells in the LRRK2 KO group (Fig. 6E, F).2.6.        Increased dendritic complexity of young immatureneurons in the adult DG of LRRK2 KO miceTo study the effect of LRRK2 KO on the dendritic morphology of newly generated young immature neurons, we analyzed thelength  of  DCXþ  dendrites  in  the  DG.  Interestingly,  dendrite length  was  1.4  fold  increased  in  LRRK2  KO  mice  comparedwith  WT  littermate  controls  (Control  15079 mm;  LRRK2  KO359717 mm; po0.0001; Fig. 6B). We further analyzed the effect ofLRRK2 KO on dendritogenesis by quantifying the number of dendrite  branching  points.  We  observed  a  highly  significantincrease of dendrite branching points of DCXþ cells in the DG of LRRK2 KO mice by 2.4 fold compared to controls (Control1.670.11; LRRK2 KO 5.670.3; po0.0001; Fig. 6C). The complexityof  dendrites  in  LRRK2  KO  mice  was  further  confirmed  byquantifying   the   number   of   DCXþ   processes   intersecting concentric spheres that were placed around the DCXþ cell soma. In  parallel  to  (Arisi  and  Garcia-Cairasco,  2007),  most  of  thedendrites ended within the 50 mm and 100 mm circle, thereforein the inner molecular layer. The number of DCXþ processes crossing concentric spheres of those 50 mm and 100 mm radii were significantly increased in LRRK2 KO mice compared tocontrols   (50 mm:   Control   1.7570.11;   LRRK2   KO   2.6370.66;p¼ 0.018;   100 mm:   Control   1.970.67;   LRRK2   KO   3.570.6;p¼ 0.004; Fig. 6D). Thus, the summed dendritic length in the inner molecular layer, resulting from this pattern of terminationand arborization, was significantly increased in LRRK2 KO mice. Within further distance of 150 mm and 200 mm from the cellsoma the total number of intersecting DCXþ processes appeared higher in the LRRK2 KO group, however without reaching thesignificance   level   (150 mm:   Control   0.6370.47;   LRRK2   KO1.7271.33;   p¼ 0.12;   200 mm:   Control   0.1570.17;   LRRK2   KO1.2771.29; p¼ 0.09; Fig. 6D). Representative images illustrate the increased length and more complex arborization of dendrites inthe  LRRK2  KO  group  (Fig.  6G,  H).  This  finding  supports  the important role of LRRK2 for dendritic morphogenesis in newlygenerated DCXþ hippocampal neuroblasts (MacLeod et al., 2006; Parisiadou et al., 2009; Winner et al., 2011b).2.7.        Increased density of early and intermediate DCXþneuroblast subsets in the adult DG of LRRK2 KO miceDCX expression during adult neurogenesis begins at an early proliferation stage and extends until 3–4 weeks after the birth of the new cells (Brown et al., 2003). Following the increasedtotal number of DCXþ cells in LRRK2 KO mice, we further explored if LRRK2 has an additional impact on the matura-tion and migration process of neuroblasts during their first month of development. Morphological characteristics regarding dendritic processes as well as location within the DG granularlayer allow the distinction between different DCXþ populations (early, intermediate, and late; see schematic drawing; Fig. 7A),representative of  different  stages  of  neuronal maturation (Plumpe  et  al.,  2006).  According  to  these  morphological characteristics, we did not observe significant differences inthe percentage of early, intermediate, and late DCXþ stages per total number of DCXþ cells between LRRK2 KO mice and WT littermate controls (early: Control 39.171%; LRRK2 KO34.674.2%; p ¼ 0.32; intermediate: Control 34.271.7%; LRRK2 KO 38.172.7%; p ¼ 0.26; late: Control 26.771.3%; LRRK2 KO27.374.8%; p ¼ 0.9; Fig. 7B–D). But, normalization of the total numbers of different DCX subpopulations to the volume ofthe DG revealed a significant increase of the density of earlyand  intermediate  DCXþ  neuroblasts  in  LRRK2  KO  mice, whereas the density of late DCXþ young immature neurons was not significantly altered (early: Control 30447221; LRRK2KO  41027369.5;  p ¼ 0.04;  intermediate:  Control  26477152; LRRK2  KO  46317513;  p ¼ 0.006;  late:  Control  20737140.5; LRRK2  KO  366771231;  p ¼ 0.23).  Values  are  represented  as cells/mm3 Â 109.2.8.        Volume of the mossy fiber projection is increasedin LRRK2 KO miceTo study if LRRK2 KO has an effect on the axonal output of the DG we further analyzed the morphology of the mossy fiber (MF) tract projecting from the dentate granule cells to the CA3 pyramidal neurons. The zinc-enriched MF bundle is reliably visualized using antibodies against zink-transporter- 3 (ZnT-3) (Wenzel et al., 1997). The three major MF subfields, including the hilar MFs, supra-pyramidal (SP) MFs, and intra-infra-pyramidal (IIP) MFs, were thus analyzed (see schematic representation;  Fig.  8).  The  volume  of  the  SP  MFs  was significantly increased by 45% in the LRRK2 KO group com- pared  to  the  WT  littermate  controls  (Control  0.20070.02;LRRK2 KO 0.28770.01; p ¼ 0.008). The volume of the IIP MFs was larger in LRRK2 KO mice compared to WT littermatecontrols,  but  did  not  reach  significance  level  (Control0.04870.003; LRRK2 KO 0.05670.002; p ¼ 0.066). No significant differences between both groups were found in the volume ofthe  hilar  MFs  (Control  0.16270.02;  LRRK2  KO  0.14370.01;p ¼ 0318). Volumes are represented in mm3 Â 10À9. By normal- izing volumes of the SP MFs and IIP MFs to that of the DGboth volumes were significantly increased in the LRRK2 KO group compared to WT littermate controls (SP MFs: Control0.5370.04; LRRK2 KO 0.7570.05; p ¼ 0.012; Fig. 9A; IIP MFs: Control 0.1170.005; LRRK2 KO 0.1470.007; p ¼ 0.004; Fig. 9B). However,  the  normalized  volume  of  the  hilar  MFs  wasconsistently  unchanged  between  both  groups  (Hilar  MFs:Control  0.3670.03;  LRRK2  KO  0.3770.02;  p ¼ 0.73;  Fig.  9C). Representative images illustrate the morphology of the MFbundle on anterior and posterior coronal sections (Fig. 9 D–G). A comparison of the intensity of the hilar MFs did not reveal a significant  difference  between  LRRK2  KO  mice  and  WT littermate controls (data not shown). This result indicates that LRRK2 deficiency predominantly affects the size of the SP MFs, and to a lesser extent the IIP MFs as well."
28582935	LRRK2 interactome analysis in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts The endogenous expression of active LRRK2 in the Swiss 3T3 fibro-blast cell line has been shown by others (Nichols et al., 2009). For quan- titative interactome analysis, we immunoprecipitated endogenous LRRK2 from SILAC-labeled 3T3 fibroblasts and identified interacting proteins by liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spec- trometry (n=4 biological replicates per group). Both lysine- and arginine-containing peptideswere isotopically labeled with an efficien- cy of approximately 92%. Importantly, short-term treatment of the heavy-labeled 3T3 cells with the highly selective LRRK2 inhibitor LRRK2-IN1 (3 μM, 90 min) (Deng et al., 2011) before immuno- precipitation caused a significant, 18-fold increase in LRRK2 binding to tubulin-beta-2 (normalized Heavy to Light Ratio: 17.9±1.6; pb0.02). The pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity in 3T3 cells was confirmed by a decline in LRRK2(S935) phosphorylation (Dzamko et al., 2010) detectable both bymass spectrometry and immu- noblotting (Supplementary Fig. 1).In order to confirm the kinase activity-dependent LRRK2-tubulininteraction within living cells, we transiently expressed either RFP-tagged Tubulin or RFP-tagged MAP4 by using BacMam gene de- livery in HEK293 cells overexpressing GFP-tagged LRRK2. As shown in Fig. 1, the GFP-to-RFP FRET signal from both microtubule- associated fusion proteins increased significantly (pb0.05) when cells were treated with LRRK2-IN1 (3 μM, 90 min). Similar results were obtained by using the structurally-different, less selective LRRK2 inhibitor sunitinib (not shown) (Nichols et al., 2009). The 2- to 3-fold assay windows observed here were obtained in an unoptimized assay format where cell-background-specific effects and the role of endogenous tubulin (which is abundant and non- RFP-tagged) could influence the FRET signal. Previous studies demonstrated that the inhibition of GFP-taggedLRRK2 using thenonselective LRRK2 inhibitorH-1152 induces the accu- mulation of LRRK2 in cytoplasmic fibrillar aggregates that partially colocalized with tubulin immunoreactivity (Dzamko et al., 2010). In the present study, heterogeneous expression of GFP-tagged LRRK2 in stably transfected HEK293 cells was detected and the aggregates of GFP-LRRK2 were already visible in control cells expressing high levels of LRRK2 (Supplementary Fig. 2). After treatmentwith LRRK2-IN1 cyto- plasmicGFP-LRRK2 accumulatedintofibrillar structures insome cells as described by others (Deng et al., 2011). After colchicine treatment GFP-LRRK2 accumulated in the cell periphery (Supplementary Fig. 2). Overall, the expression and localization of GFP-tagged LRRK2 in overexpressing HEK293 cells were too heterogeneous for quantitative digital image analysis.LRRK2(S935) phosphorylation is decreased by microtubule destabilizing drugsSince the pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity promotes its binding to tubulin in cells (shown above),we testedwhether themicrotubule cytoskeleton might influence LRRK2 kinase activity as shown for other kinases (Archambault et al., 2008; Toya et al., 2011). For medium-throughput compound testing we established a cellular assay for LRRK2(S935) phosphorylation based on LanthaScreen time- resolved FRET technology. Two distinct microtubule destabilizing agents, colchicine and vinblastine (Jordan andWilson, 2004),were test- ed in this assay format and a rapid, dose-dependent signal decrease by approximately 40% was observed (Figs. 2A, B), whereas complete de- phosphorylation was detected after LRRK2-IN-1 treatment (Fig. 2C). This effect was reproduced in mouse primary fibroblasts treated with 1 μM colchicine for 90 min and immunoblotted for endogenous phospho-LRRK2(S935) (decrease by 42.0%±11.1%, n=6, pb0.05) (Fig. 2G). By contrast, neither the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol nor the actin depolymerizing agent Latrunculin A (Spector et al., 1989)af- fected LRRK2(S935) phosphorylation when tested in a broad concen- tration range in our cellular FRET assay (Figs. 2D, E). By microscopical inspection shortly before the cell lysis, the colchicine-treated fibroblasts appeared indistinguishable from the vehicle-treated control cultures. Moreover, total LRRK2 immunoreactive bands, phospho-ERK1/2 immunoreactive bands, and MemCode-stained protein bands did not decline on immunoblots of the colchicine-treated cells speaking against an unspecific cytotoxic effect (Fig. 2G). By testing cantharidinand cantharidic acid in our FRET assay, we identified protein phos- phatase 2A as a potent LRRK2(S935) phosphatase (Fig. 2F).Recombinant LRRK2 GTPase activity is increased by co-incubation with microtubulesLRRK2 and dynamin are members of a class of G proteins that areregulatedbyhomodimerization (Gasper et al., 2009). Since the GTPase activity of dynamin is stimulated to high levels by binding to microtu- bules in vitro (Binns et al., 1999; Shpetner and Vallee, 1992), we performed similar GTPase assays by using recombinant full-length LRRK2 (Gillardon, 2009a). LRRK2 was co-incubated with taxol- stabilized microtubules, cold-treated microtubules, or microtubule- depleted assembly buffer. The hydrolysis of [α-33P]GTP was analyzed by thin layer chromatography. Microtubule preparations alone did not exhibit significant GTPase activity under these assay conditions. In two independent experiments however, LRRK2 co-incubationwithmi- crotubules lead to a significant (pb0.05, t-test), 2-fold increase in GTPase activity compared to LRRK2 only (Fig. 2H). Collectively, these data provide strong evidence for LRRK2-tubulininteraction and support the hypothesis that microtubules may act as a scaffold for LRRK2 structural organization and emanating enzymatic activity.Cell migration is affected in LRRK2(G2019S) human fibroblasts The microtubule cytoskeleton plays an essential role in cell migra-tion, cell division, and cell shape (Gardel et al., 2010; Parisiadou and Cai, 2010). To assess a potential influence of LRRK2 on cell migration, human primary fibroblasts were confluently plated in cell culture in- serts with a defined cell-free space of 500 μm. Fourteen hours after the removal of the culture insert, the cell-free space that had been in- vaded by migrating fibroblasts was measured. LRRK2(G2019S) mu- tant fibroblasts showed a trend (p>0.05) towards an enhanced migration (Fig. 3) (remaining cell-free space: G2019S 38.4%±4.5%; Control 47.0%±4.7%). Three different LRRK2(G2019S) and four dif- ferent healthy donor fibroblast lines were used. Four biological repli- cates per cell line were analyzed. Additionally, cell size, cell shape (perimeter, circularity, aspect ratio), and cell spreading did not signif- icantly differ between mutant and control fibroblasts. Similar LRRK2protein levels were detected in mutant and wildtype human fibro- blasts by immunoblotting (Fig. 3).Lesioning-induced cell migration is enhanced in LRRK2(R1441G) mouse fibroblastsNext we investigated the influence of LRRK2 on themigration of primary fibroblasts when the cell layer is damaged by a mechanical scratch, a well established cell culture model of wound healing (Larson et al., 2010). To assess a more homogenous cell population, we performed the scratch assay by using dermal fibroblasts isolated from LRRK2(R1441G) transgenic mice (Li et al., 2009)and their wildtype littermates. Consistent with our findings in human fibroblast cultures,mousefibroblasts carrying thePD-linked LRRK2(R1441G)mu- tation showed a significantly (pb0.005) enhanced invasion of the cell-free space (Fig. 4) (remaining cell-free space: Wildtype 21.5%± 2.4%; R1441G 10.4%±1.9%). In contrast, the lesion-induced migration of fibroblasts from LRRK2 knockout mice was significantly (pb0.05) slower compared to the corresponding wildtype mice (remaining cell-free space: wildtype 24.4%±4.1%; knockout 37.0%±4.1%). In all experiments, the fibroblasts were isolated from 3 individual mice per genotype, andat least 3 biological replicates eachwere tested. The effect size of LRRK2mutation/deficiency on fibroblast migration in the scratch assay is comparable to other gene mutations that are known to affect themicrotubule cytoskeleton (Francis et al., 2011; Larson et al., 2010). Treatment of mouse fibroblasts with the highly selective LRRK2inhibitor LRRK2-IN1 slowed down cellmigration in LRRK2 express- ing fibroblasts, but not in LRRK2-deficient fibroblasts clearly indi- cating that LRRK2 influences fibroblast motility (Fig. 4E). LRRK2- IN1 inhibits MAPK7 and DCLK1 at higher concentrations (Deng et al., 2011) which might contribute to its effects on cell migration. However, our gene chip database indicates that neither MAPK7 nor DCLK1 is expressed in the skin samples or fibroblast cultures further supporting a role of LRRK2 in fibroblast migration. LRRK2- IN1 completely blocked the phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser-910 and Ser-935 (Fig. 4F) indicating the pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity (Dzamko et al., 2010). Total LRRK2 protein levels in dermal fibroblasts of LRRK2(R1441G) transgenic mice did not significantly differ from the wildtype controls (111%±8%, n=7, p=0.2) as detected by immunoblotting by using a monoclo- nal antibody (MJFF c41-2) that recognizes both human and endog- enous mouse LRRK2 (Fig. 4F). Immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody (MJFF c81-8) that preferentially recognizes human LRRK2 confirmed the expression of human LRRK2(R1441G) in primary fi- broblasts from transgenic mice. Since cell adhesion is an essential factor influencing cellmigration, a standard cell adhesion assay was performed (Guo et al., 2006). The number of fibroblasts that were adherent at different time points after seeding andwashing did not differ between the genotypes demonstrat- ing that LRRK2 does not influence cell adhesion (Supplementary Fig. 3). Similarly, cell size, cell shape (perimeter, circularity, aspect ratio), and cell spreading did not significantly differ between the genotypes. Final- ly, an Alamar blue assaywas performed to assure that differences in fi- broblast migration are not due to alterations in cell viability or proliferation rate. Mutant and wildtype fibroblasts did not show any differences in this assay over 24 h (data not shown)."
28582939	Identification of LRRK2 in exosomesLRRK2 action in the endocytic pathway may include aspects of lysosomal and autophagy-mediated degradation, receptor recycling, and vesicle budding. Evidence of LRRK2 association with MVBs, the obligate source of exosomes, was observed previously (16). Our past studies demonstrated that the highest expression of endogenous LRRK2 in mice is in the kidney (13), and the kidneys are known to secrete high quantities of exosomes into urine. To test whether LRRK2 can be secreted in urinary exosomes, we isolated a 100K × g pellet (P100) into lysis buffer together with an equivalent-volume concentrated supernatant from healthy human subjects and measured the LRRK2 protein content via western blot (Fig. 1A). LRRK2 was present at an approximate concentration of 1 pg/ml of urine, and all of the LRRK2 protein localized to the P100 (exosome) fraction. Exosomes are organelles that maintain the orientation of the proteins from the parental cells, so that extracellular proteins or extracellular protein domains remain extra-exosomal, whereas cell cytosolic proteins are encapsulated within the exosome (31). A trypsin-sensitivity assay demonstrated that the addition of triton-X 100 detergent to break the vesicles was required for proteolytic digestion of LRRK2, suggesting that LRRK2 is localized within exosomes (Fig. 1B). The LRRK2 binding partner 14-3-3 was also sensitive to trypsin degradation in the presence of a detergent. In contrast, CD9 is known to be present in a large trans-luminal protein complex within the plasma membrane that was resistant to trypsin digestion whether or not the detergent was added.Next, the P100 fraction was separated on an iodixanol density gradient and LRRK2 was found to float in the same fraction as the canonical exosome proteins Alix and TSG101 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that LRRK2 specifically resides within exosomes. CD9 is a transmembrane protein that is abundant in plasma membrane-derived vesicles that traffic to MVBs (32,33). We found that CD9 diffusely spreads across the high-density fractions, with the highest concentration in the exosome-containing fraction. Under native (non-crosslinked or dehydrated) conditions, the exosomes were perfectly spherical with intra-exosome puncta composing a dense vesicle core, as visualized using cryo-electron microscopy (EM, Fig. 1D). We localized LRRK2 immunoreactivity to isolated exosomes using a super-resolution technique (stimulated emission depletion microscopy) and found structures also of ~100 nm in size with LRRK2 protein primarily concentrated in the exosome core (Fig. 1E). CD9 has been previously used in fluorescent and immunoaffinity approaches to purify exosomes, but we found complete exclusion of LRRK2 immunoreactivity in CD9-positive exosomes via immunofluorescence in dilute exosome preparations (Fig. 1F). In contrast, LRRK2 partially co-localized to TSG101-enriched exosomes, although examples of TSG101-positive exosomes with weak or no detectable LRRK2 expression could also be observed. As CD9 is a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane protein, this could indicate that the intracellular source of LRRK2-positive exosomes could be distinct from plasma membrane-derived exosomes.Both LRRK2 dimerization and phosphorylation are activities that have been linked to LRRK2 kinase activity (34,35). To assess LRRK2 dimerization, urinary exosomes were resuspended in buffer containing the non-ionic detergent triton X-100 and lysates analyzed by native-PAGE (Fig. 1G). Urinary exosome LRRK2 migration was identical to that of endogenous and kinase-active LRRK2 isolated from cell cytosols (34). Low amounts of LRRK2 in preparations without detergent treatment were likely due to exosome breakage during processing, but show that the detergent did not alter the migration pattern of LRRK2 in native gels. To measure LRRK2 phosphorylation, 10 µg of total protein from exosomes was compared with 10 µg of total protein isolated from low-post-mortem interval human brain cerebral cortex (brain samples described previously for LRRK2 expression (36)), together with 1 ng of recombinant LRRK2 protein derived from HEK-293T cells (Fig. 1H). The recombinant protein is known to be heavily phosphorylated at serine 935 (pS935) (10). pS935 levels were comparable between recombinant kinase-active LRRK2 and urinary exosome-derived LRRK2. In comparison, much lower levels of total and pS935 LRRK2 were detected in human brain.These results demonstrate LRRK2 can be readily measured from urinary exosomes, and that LRRK2 protein in exosomes derives from the cell cytosol, either captured in vesicles that fuse with MVBs, or packaged during the inward internalization of vesicles fusing with MVBs. Although LRRK2 protein concentration is appreciable in urinary exosomes, the overall levels are not sufficient to directly assess LRRK2 kinase activity with any described kinase activity assay.Localization of LRRK2 to kidney luminal tubule cells and characterization of urinary exosome proteomesThe sources of urinary exosomes are not fully understood, although the kidney is thought to be the major contributor (37). Staining for LRRK2 in healthy rat kidneys revealed intense LRRK2 expression in virtually all segments of the outer and inner collecting duct epithelium, with reactive cells directly abutting luminal spaces (Fig. 2A). In contrast, rat LRRK2 KO kidneys are non-reactive under identical staining conditions, albeit with minor nonspecific reactivity observed in a subset of nuclei (Fig. 2B). Since the collecting duct epithelium cells specifically are hypothesized to be contributors toward the urinary exosome pool, these results explain in part the source of LRRK2 in urinary exosomes. It is possible that LRRK2 protein interactors in exosomes may chaperone and control LRRK2 vesicular association. Although several urinary exosome proteomic studies have been performed, these have been qualitative assessments that have not capitalized on recent and dramatic improvements in the proteomic technology. To quantitatively measure the exosome proteome, urinary exosomes were pooled from six healthy controls, and the resultant exosomes were split into six equal fractions that were labeled with tandem isobaric mass tags and analyzed by long-column multi-dimensional protein identification (TMT-MudPIT). Five two hundred and sixty-eight peptides were identified and quantifiable that corresponds to 1673 protein identifications (Supplementary Material, Database 1). Of the 1673 proteins, 965 mapped to unique GeneGO objects with assigned function, and the GO process ‘cellular component organization’ was significantly enriched, owing to the high concentration of components of the actin cytoskeleton and known vesicle components [false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P = 5.2 × 10−41]. A number of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases were identified in exosomes besides LRRK2, such as DJ-1, ApoE and Nerprelysin. LRRK2-interacting proteins, including 14-3-3ɛ (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1), HSP70/90, ezrin/moesin/ radixin, and Rab7, were all identified at levels comparable with the most abundant exosome proteins (Fig. 2C). Despite previous studies that indicate some of these interactors as potential kinase substrates, we were unable to show that LRRK2 could phosphorylate any proteins from exosome lysates (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2).Among the urinary exosome proteins detected, several highly expressed proteins were identified that are considered exclusive or highly enriched in organs other than the kidney (38). These organs include prostate, stomach, pancreas, liver and colon (Fig. 2D), where LRRK2 expression of differing levels can also be detected (13). Notably, we did not obtain any evidence that brain specific proteins were present in urinary exosomes. Thus, it is possible that LRRK2 protein in urinary exosomes originate from these organs, in addition to the kidney.14-3-3 Binding to LRRK2 controls LRRK2 exosome releaseWe and others have found that LRRK2 may be tightly bound to heat-shock proteins and 14-3-3 chaperones that may control LRRK2 solubility and oligomerization (10,30,39,40). We sought to test whether interactions with these proteins may control LRRK2 extracellular secretion. First, we determined that HEK-293T cells transfected with LRRK2 actively secrete exosomes into cell culture media (Fig. 3A). While knockdown of all 14-3-3 isoforms in HEK-293T cells is difficult to accomplish, a short-peptide inhibitor known as difopein has been developed in HEK-293T cells that effectively acts as a pan 14-3-3 inhibitor by blocking 14-3-3 dimerization (41). Transfection of difopein in LRRK2-expressing HEK-293T cells resulted in a very efficient ablation of LRRK2 binding to 14-3-3 proteins, as observed through immunoprecipitation assays using a pan-14-3-3 antibody (Fig. 3B). In cells expressing both LRRK2 and difopein, LRRK2 could no longer be detected in resultant exosome fractions, yet cytosolic levels of LRRK2 and 14-3-3 (pan) remained unaltered. Likewise, difopein treatment did not have any significant effects on total exosome release, indicating 14-3-3 proteins are dispensable for exosome biogenesis and processing.Acute LRRK2 kinase inhibition via small molecules causes a reduction in 14-3-3 binding to LRRK2 (30). To test whether acute kinase inhibition-mediated loss of 14-3-3 binding would also disrupt LRRK2 release in exosomes, we first characterized the two most potent and specific LRRK2 kinase inhibitors described. HG-10-102 (42), that is known to be a selective LRRK2 inhibitor, and the widely utilized L2in1 compound (35), were first defined for potency in a kinase inhibition assay measuring LRRK2 autophosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 3C,D). When applied to HEK-293T cells at 1 µm concentration, these two compounds had comparable effects in reducing 14-3-3 (pan) binding to LRRK2 and reducing LRRK2 release in exosomes (Fig. 3E). Unexpectedly, treatment with L2in1, a known inhibitor of ERK5, and possibly Aurora A and CHK2, also blocked overall exosome release in HEK-293T cells, as determined by lower levels of TSG101 (Fig. 3E) and other markers evaluated such as Alix and CD9. Over expression of 14-3-3ɛ, the most abundant 14-3-3 isoform identified in urinary exosomes (Supplementary Material, Fig. and Database 1), restored 14-3-3 binding to LRRK2 and exosome release (Fig. 3E).The cytosolic distribution of LRRK2 may be important for LRRK2 packaging into exosomes. Using immunofluorescence localization in HEK-293T cells over-expressing LRRK2 protein, we observe a diffuse yet punctate cytoplasmic localization of LRRK2 Figure 4A). In cells co-expressing the small peptide difopein, LRRK2 redistributes to concentrated perinuclear structures (Fig. 4C), whereas exposure to LRRK2 kinase inhibitors renders LRRK2 to skein-like structures (Fig. 4E,F), consistent with previous reports evaluating L2in1 exposures (30). We found that 14-3-3ɛ over expression rescued the normal localization of LRRK2 (Fig. 4G,H). These results demonstrate how 14-3-3 binding to LRRK2 alters subcellular localization, where diffuse cytoplasmic distribution correlates to extracellular secretion.Because LRRK2 cytoplasmic distribution appears to critically mediate extracellular secretion, we next co-localized LRRK2 with the exosome marker TSG101 in HEK-293T cells that constitutively secrete exosomes. While TSG101 had a discrete vesicular-like distribution, LRRK2 was more evenly expressed across the cytosol with rarer examples of discrete vesicle-sized puncta, clearly distinguishing LRRK2 from a canonical vesicular protein (Fig. 5A). Some previous evidence suggests that the G2019S mutation may alter this cytoplasmic distribution to LRRK2-positive intracellular puncta, so we tested whether this mutation affects LRRK2 secretion. Neither G2019S nor a kinase-inactivating mutation altered overall LRRK2 secretion (Fig. 5B). These results are also consistent with past data that these alterations in LRRK2 do not affect binding to 14-3-3 proteins (39). The other protein linked to autosomal-dominant PD, α-synuclein, can also be secreted in exosomes (43). To determine whether LRRK2 may co-exist in the same exosomes as α-synuclein, we transiently co-expressed both proteins in HEK-293T cells, isolated exosomes, and analyzed the composition of the structures by immunofluorescence. No examples of co-localized exosomes were observed, suggesting that α-synuclein and LRRK2 may derive from exosomes of divergent origin. (Fig. 5C). α-Synuclein is also a binding partner for 14-3-3 isoforms, although the α-synuclein complex in exosomes has not been described.Quantification of LRRK2 in clinical exosome samplesWe collected a cohort of late-onset PD without a family history of disease (n = 20) and age-matched control samples (n = 15) from the Movement Disorder Clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, following informed consent and institutional approval, and measured LRRK2 and 14-3-3(pan) expression relative to the canonical exosome marker TSG101. Age between the PD and control cohort was similar at 62.8 ± 9.4 and 62.5 ± 13.1, respectively, and the modified Hoehn and Yahr score of the PD group was 2.2 ± 0.38.We found that both LRRK2 and 14-3-3(pan) had unexpectedly high variability in both controls and PD, as LRRK2 levels varied in the PD affected group by over two orders of magnitude, in contrast to TSG101 that showed lower variability (Fig. 6A). After exclusion of outliers from the series (identified with at least one order of magnitude above or below the population average), there were no significant differences in the expression of LRRK2 or 14-3-3 in PD versus controls (P > 0.1, Fig. 6B and C), nor did LRRK2 expression correlate well with 14-3-3 (pan) expression (Fig. 6D). There were no effects of age or gender on LRRK2 or 14-3-3 expression in urinary exosomes. High levels of LRRK2 in exosomes, more than 50-fold above the cohort average, were detected in one PD-affected subject (Fig. 6E). This subject had normal quantities of exosomes in urine and had typical late-onset PD, and we did not identify a clinical cause for these extreme levels of LRRK2 (Fig. 6F). To determine whether LRRK2 expression in urine changes over time, we collected urine from healthy control subjects over the course of a week at different times of the day and found that LRRK2 levels did not significantly vary within this period of time (Fig. 6F shows one such subject, one-way ANOVA P > 0.5). These data demonstrate the relative ease of collection and measurement of LRRK2 in clinical samples, but the data emphasize the importance of baseline measures of LRRK2 expression due to extreme inter-sample variability.LRRK2 exosomes secreted by macrophagesAs opposed to constitutive exosome secretion in active neurons and HEK-293T cells, other cells, such as macrophages, have been described with strong acute regulation of exosome release (44). We and others have found that activated macrophages of the periphery and brain express high levels of LRRK2 protein that can be induced with stimulation (11,12,45). Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line that express endogenous LRRK2 protein, we find that the exosome-associated protein TSG101 nearly evacuates from the cell cytosol, and abundant exosomes were released that contained high levels of LRRK2 expression (Fig. 7A). Thus, past-assessments of the magnitude of LRRK2 induction in macrophages would be underestimates if extracellular LRRK2 were not measured. To confirm and expand on these results, we isolated into culture primary macrophages from the mouse peritoneum of LRRK2 transgenic mice that express mouse WT-LRRK2 or G2019S-LRRK2 from BAC transgenes. Stimulation of these cells with LPS resulted in abundant LRRK2 secretion, but again the G2019S-mutation had no effect on the total quantity of LRRK2 released (Fig. 7B and C).Due to the high levels of LRRK2 expressed in primary macrophages, immunofluorescence becomes possible. While LPS had a striking effect on overall macrophage morphology from a polarized cell into an amoeboid body, a more modest perinuclear accumulation of LRRK2 and the remaining TSG101 could be observed (Fig. 7D). We did not notice an enhanced co-localization between LRRK2 and TSG101 after stimulation, suggesting that LRRK2 vesicular association is probably independent of stimulation, but overt release is critically modified by stimulation. Macrophage-derived exosomes provide an example of how LRRK2 exosome release can be physiologically regulated.LRRK2 exosomes in CSF and secretion by neuronsIn the brain, serial sectioning confirmed that the most intense LRRK2 staining was in the striatum, and many of the LRRK2-positive cells were grouped into patches resembling striosomes juxtaposed against the lateral ventricles (Fig. 8A). We rationalized that LRRK2 may be secreted into the CSF from these neurons and other LRRK2-positive cells in the brain. Two samples of CSF were prepared from control subjects and exosomes verified using cryo-EM (Fig. 8B). LRRK2 expression was determined at a concentration of ~10 pg/ml of CSF in these samples (Fig. 8C). To test whether pathogenic LRRK2 mutations affect neuronal LRRK2 exosome secretion, viral transduction of cultured neurons resulted in high levels of LRRK2 in exosomes, but these levels did not vary due to the presence of pathogenic mutations (Fig. 8D,E). Within neurons, LRRK2 occasionally localized with TSG101-positive vesicles, particularly in dendrites (Fig. 8F). As neurons have been previously described as major sources of exosomes in the brain (46, 47), it seems likely that the source of LRRK2-positive exosomes in the CSF derives from neurons expressing LRRK2."
